field is n    neural network based approaches for intelligent systems and learning control  n    In particular  our study is focused on neural network based n    adaptive critic designs  Adaptive critic designs are designs n    that approximate dynamic n       programming in the general case  i e  approximate optimal control n    over time in noisy  nonlinear environments  There are many practical n       problems that can be formulated as to minimize or maximize n    a measure of cost  n    It is well known that dynamic programming is very useful in n    solving these problems  n       However  it is often computationally untenable to run true dynamic n    programming due to the backward numerical process required for its n       solutions  i e  due to the "curse of dimensionality  n    Over the years  progress has been made to circumvent the n    "curse of dimensionality" by n       building a system  called "critic" to approximate the cost n    function in dynamic programming  The idea is to approximate dynamic n       programming solutions by using a function approximation structure n    such as neural networks to approximate the cost function  n    Our work includes methodology n    development and applications of adaptive n       critic designs to automotive engine control  nClick here for publications n n n n n Computational Intelligence Click here
