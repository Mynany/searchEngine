North Park College  Research Activities and Interests  My research at UIC in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory has focused on developing efficient artificial intelligence  AI  search techniques  This research has two components  basic research into developing general  efficient heuristic search algorithms  and applied research and development using heuristic search and other AI methods to solve problems in the areas of transportation  manufacturing  bioinformatics and high availability computer clusters Artificial Intelligence Laboratory One of our most interesting results in this area has been the development of a new heuristic search algorithm named perimeter search  This admissible technique is referred to as perimeter search since it relies on a perimeter of nodes around the goal or destination node  During the search process  generated nodes are compared to the perimeter nodes  When a match is found  the search can terminate  Analytical and experimental results were published in the Artificial Intelligence Journal showing that perimeter search is more efficient than IDA  and A  in terms of time complexity and nodes expanded for two problem domains  Additional general search results have been in the area of search algorithms that learn  a method for reducing cycles for depth first searches on graphs  and parallel bidirectional search algorithms Our Intelligent Transportation Systems  ITS  research involves improving the utilization and efficiency of existing roadway transportation systems using information technology  From          I conducted ITS research for the ADVANCE  Advanced Driver and Vehicle Advisory Navigation ConcEpt  project  supported by the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration  FHWA  ADVANCE equipped test vehicles in the northwestern suburbs of Chicago with on board computers for dynamic route planning and navigation  The vehicles received real time traffic information via RF communications from a traffic information center  allowing them to plan and update optimal routes using up to the minute traffic information  The traffic information center received traffic information from the vehicles  acting as roving traffic probes  as well as from roadway loop detectors  reliable voice reports  and other sources  I have also conducted several other ITS related projects  In         my Laboratory developed a regional Corridor Traffic Information Center for IDOT that included the first World Wide Web site to graphically display current traffic conditions  see www gcmtravel com gcm maps chicago jsp for details  The CALTRANS WWW traffic map was also developed around the same time  Our traffic map web site has over             hits per year  Another project  has developed powerful new data fusion techniques utilizing artificial neural networks  Reliable data fusion is critically important for advanced traveler information systems  which must continually combine semantically distinct probe  loop detector  anecdotal  and historical data into meaningful current traffic information  Another project  initiated by the FHWA and the Illinois  Indiana  and Wisconsin Departments of Transportation  involves the research and development of a transportation information center for the vital Gary Chicago Milwaukee Priority Corridor  one of the four federally designated ITS testbed corridors  This system distributes real time transportation and incident information throughout the corridor to agencies and the traveling public  My laboratory has also been awarded contracts to assist the Illinois Tollway Authority with the development of a state of the art traffic and incident management system  and a project with the Chicago Area Transportation Study  CATS  to development an intelligent web based ridesharing system  Additional projects include work on an incident information system for the State of Wisconsin and transit projects funded by the Federal Transit Agency through the Great Cities Universities Consortium and the Regional Transportation Authority  Additionally I am currently serving as a co PI on a      million NSF IGERT grant  Computer Science Professor Ouri Wolfson  P I  in the area of Computational Transportation Science involving four UIC colleges  for more information see cts cs uic edu www gcmtravel com gcm maps

assignment of components to the feeder slots of high devices which place IC chips onto printed wire circuit boards  in a high mix manufacturing environment  A variety of AI methods  e g  genetic algorithms  tabu search  neural networks  and rule based systems  have been utilized to consistently produce near optimal results for high speed placement over a wide class of machines  The methods and software we have developed are currently being used in Motorola factories around the world  This work has included balancing and optimizing a complete assembly line and generalizing our machine specific work into a flexible simulation and optimization toolkit  Extensions to this work include the development of the data mining software for design and manufacturing  and meta knowledge extraction and management for SMT optimization Bioinformatics research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Human Genome Research to develop a DNA restriction mapping tool  This tool automates the process of inferring DNA restriction maps from DNA segmentation data  We have studied the utility of certain AI techniques in this domain to guarantee optimal use of the data for reasoning with uncertain data  and heuristic search guided with neural networks to traverse the search space efficiently  Our restriction mapping tool has been downloaded by numerous molecular biology laboratories around the world from our homepage  More recent efforts have focused on using data mining for understanding the mechanisms of evolution and adaptation of organisms to the environment by identification of evolutionary variations of enzymes using advanced data mining approaches  Protein classification is an important method for automated protein function prediction  In      and       I also served as one of the seven founding board members for the Chicago Biomedical Consortium Proteomics and Informatics Scientific Board  in response to a     million biomedical research gift from the Searle Funds given jointly to UIC  University of Chicago and Northwestern University Chicago Biomedical Consortium Proteomics and Informatics Scientific Board Work in the area of highly available computer clustering has been supported by Sun Microsystems and the National Science Foundation  High availability  HA  in a cluster is achieved through redundancy  all critical resources have designated redundant resources that can take over the service responsibilities of the original resource in case of a failure  Our work involves applying constraint logic programming  CLP  rule based systems and heuristic search techniques to the configuration and failure handling in HA clusters   Positions Held T Bell Laboratories  Bell Communications Research  Discover Card
