Student Organizations Home American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  AIAA The AIAA  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  It is primarily dedicated to the study of aerospace and propulsion engineering  and quad copters Audio Engineering Society  AES The student chapter of the Audio Engineering Society at UIC provides opportunities for students to meet and talk with other members of the audio industry and learn directly from recognized experts in the audio field  Members are in contact with the most up to date products in the market and have access to the latest developments by researchers  and participate in meetings  workshops and discussion forums Engineering Design Team  EDT The Engineering Design Team was created by a group of engineering students whose interests were grounded in technology and robotics  The club is designed to give students a chance to use their engineering knowledge to design and build robots in order to achieve a set of goals while competing against other teams  Members can expect to become part of an active and capable team that holds a strong passion for what they do  The experience and knowledge that they gain will nurture their passion to excel as UIC students and help them develop professional engineering attitudes Engineering World Health  EWH  We achieve our mission through innovation and effective alliances with great partners  progress  and outreach programs Engineers Without Borders  EWB  safe water  public health  long distance communications and sustainable agriculture  The student chapter of EWB at University of Illinois at Chicago aims to bring together students  local engineers  and communities in the less developed countries on collaborative projects Eta Kappa Nu is the International Honor Society for Electrical and Computer Engineers  The society offers membership based on academic excellence  but also strives to assist the members to become better professionals and citizens  It encourages members to be a constructive force by helping fellow members and non members alike to improve the standards of the profession  the courses of instruction  and the institutions generally where its chapters are established Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE  conferences  technology standards and professional and educational activities  The IEEE UIC Chapter strives to promote the engineering process of creating  developing  integrating  sharing and applying knowledge about electro and information technologies as well as sciences to benefit our local community ECE Journal Club Our Club is an opportunity for engaging with colleagues in a context of curiosity  uncertainty  and depth  Come explore interesting and unpredictable topics that stretch your horizons  It is a place for anyone in the UIC community to explore ideas and research that interests them  Journal Club effectively invites our community to say  this is what I am interested in  and or this is what I am thinking National Society of Black Engineers  NSBE  who excel academically  succeed professionally  NSBE motivates its members to join the Supplemental Instruction Program  or SI  SI is a tutoring program for students by students who have passed the class with a B or higher  Outside of general body meetings  information sessions with companies like Google  IBM  ITW  GE  Navistar  and Baxter Healthcare give NSBE members an advantage in resume building  career preparation  and internship opportunities Society of Automotive Engineers  SAE The UIC Student Chapter of the Society of Automotive Engineers  SAE International  strives to promote a learning environment for all members by bettering technical  design  and practical skills within the society and into the professional world  The students design  manufacture  test  and race a mini Baja vehicle and a formula race car for rigorous collegiate competitions Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers  SHPE  access  support and development  Its vision is a world where Hispanics are highly valued and influential as the leading innovators  scientists  mathematicians  and engineers Society of Women Engineers SWE SWE is a support group for all engineering students at UIC  They coordinate events throughout the academic year that range from attending conferences to conducting outreach events for elementary school students  SWE focuses on academic and professional development so students feel prepared for graduate school and or the workforce  They strive to provide members with many different resources including scholarships and the opportunity to attend national and regional conferences  At the conferences  students can network with other future engineers and attend career fairs  which is a great way to find internships and full time employment   Student Activities at the College of Engineering UIC and the College of Engineering offer numerous student activities to complement your learning
