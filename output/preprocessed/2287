Professor Amit Ranjan Trivedi plans to change that by making smart devices smarter and safer  He is researching and developing methods for a low power intelligence away clouds and servers for the same  we are crosscutting and bridging across the stacks of technologies  circuits  and applications  We look into novel devices  harnessing these unique characteristics for a physics based implementation of machine learning and intelligence in electronics Trivedi  who directs Advanced Electronics of Nano Devices  AEON  Lab at UIC  is looking at ways to take artificial intelligence  AI  to a new level  AI has been looked at from a primarily algorithmic or software perspective  A code is written with intelligence and this code will be ported on to a PC or another platform  Unfortunately  these codes cannot be run at lower power  They are too bulky and require considerable power dissipation  Therefore  essentially  all of the intelligence is in servers  and smart devices have to communicate with the server to get instructions  because everybody has to go to this server and get the instructions from there for the intelligence  and only then they can operate on that power devices itself Speed is another challenge he is researching  Often  the distributed devices need to act very quickly to a real world event  but there is a delay as data is sent to a central location that is computing everything and telling our device what to do  Also  newer devices are coming out at a very exponential rate  and the central processor is getting over burdened  It cannot really cater to all of the small systems very quickly  We want part of the intelligence put in the low  sensors  etc  it allows you to perform complex computations of intelligence at very low power  These systems can be less than a Watt  about a Milli Watt  They can be very  very small computing chips  Right at the edge node or the sensor node you can do some intelligent computing operations  You can do something locally that actually opens up many opportunities for new applications in real time  which can immediately sense the environment and act readily Currently  an algorithm is designed without the hardware being considered  According to Trivedi  that approach lacks efficiency in terms of how fast you can operate and how low powered it can be  He is taking a bottom up approach and designing hardware  which is specially designed for intelligence computing  and we are looking to different technologies and different architectural schemes  which are more suited for this intelligence computing  much more lower power  and much more cost saving The hardware he is developing for the AI  will depend on the user history  Therefore  the hardware can adapt based on the user and it will be a more personalized hardware  Along with smarter and faster devices  there is a security component to his research  Like intelligence  achieving a low power security is also a challenge  This is especially crucial for low power distributed devices  which are out in the open and unsecured  and in a connected world  compromising even a single device can cause much bigger damage power security also needs a paradigm shift of combining technologies  circuits  and applications for an integrated approach  because I feel like they are not independent  A lot of aspects of AI can be applied to security to make it more robust  So the hardware we are developing for low powered AI may also find an application in security in the future The funding for this project was made possible by a grant from Semiconductor Research Consortium  SRC  which is sponsored by several industries including Intel  IBM  and Texas Instruments More information about Assistant Professor Amit Ranjan Trivedi research can be found at
