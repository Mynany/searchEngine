t Cuban physicians visit the UI Health Mile Square Health Center in Englewood Four physicians from Cuba are working in Chicago to improve maternal health and birth outcomes in Englewood  the physicians have been observing clinical care at Mile Square Health Center  They have also met with community leaders  including elected officials  nonprofit groups and others  to develop a picture of how health care is delivered in under resourced communities  and how their expertise may help fill gaps in care  very well  and they do it without a lot of money  Robert Winn  associate vice chancellor of community based practice at UIC and director of the University of Illinois Cancer Center Per capita  Cuba spent roughly      on health expenditures in       In the U S  this figure is above        for the same year  but life expectancy in the two countries was the same  at    years For the past year  doctors from Cuba and researchers from the cancer center have traveled between the two countries to observe practices and exchange ideas  During the exchange  the team identified a key difference between the two countries  doctors in the U S  In Cuba  we visit every home and we ask health related questions for every individual in the household  Jose Armando Arronte Villamarin  one of the physicians from Cuba who has been in Chicago since August  and it helps us focus on addressing community level public health concerns The health situation assessment tool is the cornerstone of preventive health throughout Cuban communities In Cuba  exercise and medical symptoms  Physicians in Cuba want to know if their communities have access to clean drinking water and affordable food and transportation  for example  While in the homes  doctors and nurses  with the help of medical students Based on the assessment  physicians allocate their limited resources accordingly  If a community is composed of primarily young families  physicians may invest in vaccination and family planning resources  if a significant population of the community is older  physicians may bring in resources to help minimize falls  fight cancer or facilitate transportation to medical appointments  If a community has an overabundance of standing water  mosquito remediation spraying may be ordered for that location Kathy Tossas Milligan  an epidemiologist  says that there is no process or individual level assessment like this in the U S S  we rely on random epidemiologic samples that aggregate community level data Milligan  director of global assets and innovative approaches at the UI Cancer Center  it does not provide adequate information for addressing barriers and taking action UI Health Mile Square Health Center at Englewood Learning from the Cubans and their successful experience with the health assessment  the cancer center team at UI Health is adapting the questionnaire to a U S  which is home to roughly        Chicagoans In Englewood  life expectancy is well below the national average at only    years  based on      data  The average in Chicago is    years  and    years in the U S Englewood is a predominantly black community with most households headed by single females  Compared with citywide rates  residents of Englewood experience four times the homicide rate and double the rate of infant mortality  Infant mortality rates are already three times higher for black babies in the U S  than white or Latino babies The pilot project will test the adapted health situation analysis with up to     reproductive age women  ages    to     and their families in Englewood  Researchers will connect with women through the Mile Square Health Center clinic in Englewood or community organizations  Women engaged in the pilot will be scheduled for a home health analysis visit  the first of its kind in the U S  who have been working with the Cubans since their arrival in early fall The researchers will use the assessment to get an individual  and community level picture of overall health  and to note the social and environmental factors that affect health and health behavior The goal is to use the information as a foundation for enhancing provider awareness of home life and environments  and for addressing maternal health and infant mortality outcomes  such as low birth rate and pre term births  The researchers plan to attach the information to the electronic health record and use it as the catalysts for a community debate Following the assessment  women and families in the pilot will be stratified into one of four groups based on health risk  As practiced in Cuba  they will be recommended for a range of home and office visits based on their health assessments  For example  those assigned to a group of participants who are presumed healthy  will be recommended for one office consult  Up to three home or office visits will be recommended based on risk factors  diseases and disabilities Villamarin  Dr  Berta Maria Bello Rodriguez  Dr  Sonia Maria Gonzalez Vega and Nemesis Perez Martinez  a nurse  are scheduled to be in Chicago through December A    million grant from the Kellogg Foundation funds the project  n
