Professor Devroye is Pushing the Limits of Wireless Communication Home        Natasha Devroye is making wireless communications more efficient ECE  is researching a way to make it reliable  faster  and safer An expert in information theory  which is the mathematical theory behind communications  she researches the understanding behind wireless communications like cellphones  Wi Fi  radio receivers  and more  I see it as a guide for industry for what directions to build their systems Consumers and industry experts continuously want technology pushed to the next level as they seek more data and faster speeds  There are more users  and they are streaming video  so they are demanding more bandwidth over wireless devices  Unfortunately  wireless channels are some of the hardest to deal with  Channels like underground fiber optics have extremely high data rates  and this method of communication is quite controlled  base stations  etc  Wireless signals will bounce off something  and you will see reflections  or shadows  co director of the Networks Information Communications and Engineering Systems Laboratory at UIC  and step over a meter and you have four bars  These are the effects of the wireless channel that are so variable and location dependent  yet  people want wireless communications and more of it  The number of users and the amount of data is continuously increasing To answer that question  Devroye is researching a way to obtain zero error capacity  a fundamental performance limit quantifying the number of messages that may be reliably communicated with no error over the primitive relay channel  In this channel  a source communicates with a destination in the presence of an out of band relay error capacity  which differs from the more commonly studied small error capacity Looking at zero  Information theory is a mathematical framework built upon the notion of how fast someone can communicate with vanishingly small  but positive  error in communication  She wants to determine how fast you can communicate with exactly zero error  a stricter requirement There are different ways of protecting data from errors  Redundancy is added to the data so even if some of it is corrupted  you can still reconstruct the original data  But it is not a perfect reconstruction  and it may contain some small error  What people have traditionally studied is a pretty good replica  but not perfect  to be on the safe side  Making an error in the control of an autonomous car being controlled over a wireless link is a scary thought to me This is why Devroye is researching zero error  Solving the problem with perfect reconstruction will make communication very reliable  and you can do more things through wireless Zero error problems use a branch of mathematics called combinatorics  Zero error information theory is considered to be much harder than classical information  which is based on probability theory  Whether I will be able to link this really hard math problem and zero error  I am after the theoretical limits  The big picture is we want to make the world safer  better  and more capable and flexible NSF  grants including the prestigious NSF CAREER grant  The zero Error Relay Channel  The grant supports exploratory work in its early stages on untested  but potentially transformative research ideas or approaches  involves radically different approaches  applies new expertise  or engages novel disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives Learn more her research at Devroye Profile Devroye Profile By David
