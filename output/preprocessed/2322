Prof Home         UIC LED AIR MICROFLUIDICS GROUP CREATES WEARABLE  MOBILE SENSORS TO MEASURE AIR QUALITY Dr  Igor Paprotny wants to change the air quality in Chicago  To accomplish this task  an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago  UIC  is leading the Air Microfluidics Group  AMFG  which is a research consortium that includes UIC  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  Argonne National Laboratory  University of California  Berkeley  and a researcher from the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  The team  which includes UIC students Omid Mahdavipour  Dorsa Fahimi  and John Sabino  is developing the direct read mass MEMS PM    sensor which is a potentially wearable particulate matter sensor about the size of a memory stick that could be connected to a cell phone  and provide your exposure in real time  which is about the size of a toaster or a desktop computer FRM  for PM     which is currently used as the gold standard for measuring PM    concentration Particulate matter  Particle pollution consists of a number of components  including acids  organic chemicals  metals  and soil or dust particles  According to the EPA  The EPA is concerned about particles that are    micrometers in diameter or smaller because those are the particles that generally pass through the throat and nose and enter the lungs  Once inhaled  these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects There is particulate matter that is    microns or smaller called PM    and the even smaller one is called PM     which is particulates that are     microns or smaller  A micron is     th of a millimeter  such as below     microns  they are even more dangerous  Our immune system cannot handle them because they are too big  but they are still small enough to enter deep into our respiratory system   is bad  Since EPA started regulating PM    exposure in the   s  the exposure limit has been revised several times as we learned how bad fine particles really are According to Paprotny  other low cost sensors are not very accurate in detecting particulate matter  These sensors use an optical method  and often miscalculate their actual concentration  Other precise  mass based  not optical based     to         cost sensor  We have a resonator that weighs the particles   Read Mass MEMS PM    Sensor  it will cost approximately     in large quantities to fabricate  while being much more accurate than other low cost PM    sensors  we can build a map of pollution and gather data  This sensor has the potential to make Chicago a healthier city  which has big issues with air pollution and asthma  We are also starting collaboration with the School of Public Health at UIC to investigate the connection between PM exposure and health effects          adults and         children have been diagnosed with asthma pollution could cause or promote respiratory problems such as asthma  It could also  for the first time really  provide a precise measurement of personalized PM    exposure in real time  A portable PM sensor attached to a cell phone could enable all of us to scan the air around us  This could be especially relevant with all the recent bad air pollution in Asia  We expect air around us to be clean  and it is not always the case here  are larger than     micrometers and smaller than    micrometers in diameter  are     micrometers in diameter and smaller  These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires  or they can form when gases emitted from power plants  industries and automobiles react in the air By David Staudacher  UIC David Staudacher Source  U S  Environmental Protection Agency   Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus
