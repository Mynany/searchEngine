wound therapy in obese and diabetic patients With a      million  two year grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  researchers in the UIC Epicenter for Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections will determine whether negative pressure wound therapy can help reduce the incidents of surgical site infections in obese and diabetic patients First ever guidelines for detecting  treating perimenopausal depression First ever guidelines for detecting  treating perimenopausal depression It is well recognized that women are at increased risk of depression during the postpartum period when hormone levels are changing  but the risk of depression associated with perimenopause remains under recognized and clinical recommendations on how to diagnose and treat this kind of depression in women have been lacking until now Tailoring behavioral therapy for depression  obesity based on how the brain responds Tailoring behavioral therapy for depression  obesity based on how the brain responds Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago  in collaboration with their colleagues at Stanford University and the University of Washington  will look at how an integrated behavioral therapy aimed at helping people with co occurring obesity and depression can be adapted for individuals based on how their brain function changes in response to the intervention
