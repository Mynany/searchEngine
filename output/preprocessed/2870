Giving tlowery  Planned Giving Options Just as there are many ways your IGNITE support can enhance the University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford   there are a variety of giving methods that will help you align your financial and philanthropic goals  We can work with you and your advisors to develop a giving plan that best fits your objectives Charitable giving decisions involve careful consideration of assets to be transferred and instruments used to make gifts  We invite you to review the information below to learn some common planned gift methods   Please note that the University of Illinois Foundation and the College encourage all donors to consult with their personal tax  financial and or legal advisors to discuss the implications associated with their decisions  This material on this site and associated links is intended to be used only for informational purposes  Regardless of which method you choose though  please note that all gifts should be made to the University of Illinois Foundation for the benefit of the University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford Gifts of Securities Publically traded stock and mutual funds with large unrealized profits  long term capital gains  make great gift options  The profit on your donated securities will escape taxation and your charitable deduction will be the full market value of your investment as long as you have held your security for more than one year  Your gifts of securities may be deducted up to    percent of adjusted gross income with a five year carryover for excess deductions uif uillinois edu or                for updated gifts of securities delivery instructions cashdesk uif uillinois edu Charitable IRA Rollover  you are permitted to transfer up to          annually from your IRA to a qualified charity like the Foundation  The funds must come directly from your IRA provider with the check written to the Foundation  The direct transfer has two main benefits     Any funds transferred will count towards or cover your required minimum distribution   for that tax year  and    distributions are not added to your taxable income   Please note that while you will not receive a charitable deduction for these gifts  excluding them from your income is more advantageous than a deduction To make your rollover gift  Urbana  IL        for the benefit of the College Estate Gifts A bequest is one of the simplest ways to make a deferred gift  Your bequest can be for a specific amount  a specific asset or a percentage of your estate  Any of these options allow you to make generous gifts while maintaining control of your assets during your life  Bequests given to the Foundation are not subject to estate tax Similar options also exist for retirement plan or whole life insurance beneficiary designations and transferable on death or payable on death accounts  Our Director of Gift Planning can work with you or your adviser to develop customized bequest language that accurately reflects your wishes to support the College and ensures your gift will be used as you intend Charitable Gift Annuities A charitable gift annuity  CGA  is an easy  popular option that allows you to transfer cash or appreciated  marketable securities to the Foundation  and  in exchange  After the income beneficiaries pass away  the remaining funds are used to support the College  CGA donors also receive an immediate income tax deduction  subject to applicable limitations  and  in most cases  a portion of their payments tax free  CGAs also offer capital gains tax savings should you decide to use appreciated securities to fund your annuity  The minimum amount necessary to create a CGA is          and all income beneficiaries must be at least    years of age when payments begin CGAs are not available in a small number of states  Please contact our Director of Gift Planning for a free  no obligation illustration or further information Charitable Trusts We also have options   that allow you to transfer assets to the Foundation to put in a trust which then makes payments to you or others for life  or a combination of the two  When your trust terminates  its remaining assets are used to support the College  These trusts must be created with at least         in assets Other options   allow you to provide annual gifts to the Foundation for the benefit of the College for a set term and  at the end of that term  pass the remaining assets to individuals you designate  You decide how long payments will be made to the Foundation and when the remaining assets will be distributed to your benefitting individuals  This option may reduce gift  estate and generation skipping transfer taxes  Our Director of Gift Planning can also provide you with a free  no obligation illustration or further information for any charitable trust option Retained Life Estate A retained life estate allows you to gift  at your passing  your personal residence or farm to the Foundation for the benefit of the College while allowing you and other named beneficiaries to live on the property during your life  Upon the death of all beneficiaries  the Foundation will receive your property with the right to sell it to support the College  A retained life estate agreement is irrevocable  and the College will not realize your gift until the passing of all the named beneficiaries  Like all gifts of real estate  the Foundation collects and reviews information about each proposed retained life estate before accepting it For further information  please contact Director of Gift Planning Jason James Shuba
