Engineering Design Team Continues Its Winning Ways Home        Students Nab Third Place at Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition  Second Place at NASA Competition EDT  are winners In early June  the team earned third place in the Design Competition with its R E V O  robot during the   th Annual Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition  IGVC  at Oakland University in Rochester  Michigan  where they competed against schools from around the world For the Design Competition  the team submitted a written report  gave an oral presentation  and performed a vehicle demonstration to the IGVC design judge panel  UIC competed against more than    colleges from around the world during the competition and missed second place by two points The competition challenges students to a world class design and systems engineering experience that is at the cutting edge of engineering education  It is multi disciplinary  theory based  hands on  team implemented  outcome assessed  and based on autonomous vehicle system product realization  For their efforts  the teams receive professional recognition for achievement and cash awards For UIC  the third  The team then changed our focus to the design presentations and testing the robots  an Electrical Engineering student from La Grange Park  Illinois  It is always exciting to represent the team  the college  and the university The switch in plans was a challenge for the team  but their education at UIC prepared them for this type of dilemma  I have the added pressure of the whole electrical system working  The college of engineering does an excellent job at preparing any ECE student  EDT has grown with me  reinforcing the theory I learn in the classroom  and in applications that go beyond the ECE laboratory NASA Robotics Mining Competition In May The annual contest  hosted by NASA  gives students from across the nation the opportunity to design  build  and operate robotic explorers in a bin loaded with simulated Martian soil called regolith  The Caterpillar Autonomy Award is awarded to the teams with the most autonomous points averaged from both mining attempts UIC competed against hundreds of students from    college teams from across the nation including teams from Alaska  Hawaii and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  The team also ran into problems before the competition  but their education proved they are ready to make decisions and solve problems  a Computer Engineering student from Bridgeview  Illinois  The whole team helped with any issues that arose during the week of the competition  even non ECE majors The competition is a mixed bag of emotions  The team members are tired  stressed  and their minds race through hundreds of thoughts at once  They are reliving every practice  every malfunction  and every laugh  However  their education and months of preparation kept their vision completely clear  which led to the victory The team is made up of dedicated students and alumni from Electrical and Computer Engineering  Computer Science  and from Mechanical and Industrial Engineering  who all bring a unique skill and perspective to the competition  Most importantly  it creates an atmosphere of unity and camaraderie with that reaches across departments  writing the systems engineering paper  or just discussing classes  The team of next generation scientists  technicians and engineers compete in several competitions annually and help younger students develop their engineering skills  This past year  students and alumni taught more than    new members engineering tools during teaching sessions and competitions  Outside of UIC  the team supports high school and elementary school students throughout the region with demonstrations  judging and technical assistance Learn more about the
