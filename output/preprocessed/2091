students with a valid email address through which they can receive an invitation and notifications regarding the School Forms  then they are considered to have opted out of the electronic submission method and instructed to turn in hard copies of the forms to their counselor for submission Is assigning the School Forms required by the applicant  When are the School Forms assigned  Yes  applicants must assign the School Forms in order to complete and submit their Common Application Is the School Report required   Yes  the School Report form is a required component of the Common Application  However  UIC does not require you to submit a full  personalized recommendation letter for each of your students and will not make an application incomplete if the School Report is not received Do I need to write a letter of recommendation for every student  No  you may select either of the "opt out" options rather than writing an individual recommendation for every student  Applicants will not be penalized if their counselor is unable or chooses not to supply a recommendation  Counselor recommendations  just like personal statements  are often beneficial during our review process but they can never hurt an applicant  s chances of admission If neither of the "opt out" options accurately describes my relationship with my student  how should I proceed   UIC understands that counselors may be uncomfortable selecting either of the "opt out" options on the School Report  We are unfortunately unable to change any of the language on the Common Application  We would like to emphasize that applicants will not be penalized either way  General recommendations  even if written and submitted to another university  are perfectly acceptable Are general letters of recommendation acceptable   Yes  UIC and all other Common Application schools are willing to accept general recommendation letters that may have been written or submitted to other institutions Will not submitting a recommendation have a negative impact on an application   No  UIC has not required letters of recommendation in the past and will not require them as we switch to the Common Application  Students will not be penalized in any way if recommendation letters are not submitted  Letters of recommendation will continue to be used as a positive consideration but if not submitted  will not negatively affect a student s chances of being admitted How can transcripts be submitted  Electronic submission is preferred  Electronically submit transcripts by attaching them to the Common Application School Report or through a separate submission service such as Docufide or E Script How can a fee waiver be requested   UIC will accept either the NACAC or CollegeBoard fee waiver request forms for First Year applications  Both forms must be signed and submitted by the high school counselor  Those applicants who opted out of the electronic School Forms process are instructed by the Common Application to supply a paper copy of the waiver request to their counselor for submission How can I check the status of an application for one of my students   The School Forms system shows basic status information for each of your students  including the type of application and date of submission  Counselors are also invited to contact the Office of Admissions at                to discuss missing credentials  issues with the application or to check the status of an application  We encourage applicants to call our office themselves to discuss specific decisions or to edit personal information from the application Related Resources Links Visit Campus Explore UIC Contact Admissions Deadlines and Requirements UnderGraduate Graduate   Professional  Office of Admissions      West Harrison Street
