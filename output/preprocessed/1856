Crisis and Support Hotline                available     pm Sunday Friday  or go to the nearest hospital Emergency Room  See our Crisis Services page for additional information and resources Crisis Services page What can I expect from my first appointment  The first thing you will be asked to do when you arrive is to complete preliminary information forms using a computer in our reception area   If you are not able to use the computer  alternate means to complete these forms can be provided  These forms ask about demographic and contact information and include a questionnaire that gives us an idea of your most pressing concerns  You will also be asked to read and sign forms that explain our confidentiality policy and your rights and responsibilities in counseling  In order to ensure that there is enough time to complete this process  we ask that you arrive approximately    minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time  After you have completed all forms  this information goes to the receptionist  who will make them available to your scheduled counselor to review before your session After reviewing your completed paperwork  a counselor will meet you in the waiting room and walk with you to their office to speak in private  The purpose of the first session at the Counseling Center is to assess your concerns and to develop a plan of how to address those concerns  The session can also be used to begin to address any urgent issues  During your meeting with the counselor  you will have a chance to describe why you are seeking assistance and why you have chosen this particular time to do so  The counselor will explain and answer your questions about the counseling process  They will ask for information about your present situation  your family background  general health and self care  and important relationships in your life  You may be asked to discuss past experiences with this or similar problems and how you have tried to solve them Some students find that talking with a counselor once is sufficient to resolve the immediate concern  If further services would be beneficial  these will be discussed  and a recommendation will be made by the counselor  These additional services may include resources offered by the Counseling Center or referral to another campus or community resource How much does counseling cost  The Counseling Center is supported by the Health Service Fee as already assessed to students enrolled at the university  Enrolled students are therefore eligible for Counseling Center mental health services without additional cost What is the Counseling Center policy on confidentiality  We adhere fully to applicable professional  legal and ethical standards  Information you provide in the course of counseling is held as confidential

following limited exceptions  instances of imminent risk of harm to yourself or others  mandated reporting of current child or elder abuse  or a court order and legal subpoena  The exceptions are rare  and your counselor generally will discuss the decision with you and seek your consent before such action is taken  If you have designated an Emergency Mental Health Contact person  we are obligated by law to contact that person within    hours if you are assessed as being at imminent risk  Please know that you may rescind  change  or add an Emergency Mental Health Contact person by logging into your UIC student portal at my UIC edu Will my parents  faculty  and or others be informed that I am going to the Counseling Center  We cannot release any information about you to another party without your written consent except in the specific situations described above Will the fact that I am seen at the Counseling Center be on my academic record  No  Counseling Center records are kept completely

obtaining medical treatment Can the Counseling Center help me find a therapist off campus  One of the services the Counseling Center provides is assisting students in connecting with services in the community by referral  when appropriate  This can be especially helpful if you are looking for longer term counseling or are considering leaving or taking some time off from the university before you would be finished with counseling  We have a variety of providers to choose from who work regularly with UIC students  including some with sliding fee scales Does the Counseling Center prescribe psychiatric medication  We have a psychiatrist on staff who can prescribe medication to students who are in ongoing therapy at the center  If you are already taking medication and are looking to transfer your care to UIC without entering therapy  we can assist you with referral options on campus or in the community  See the description of Integrative Psychiatry Services  internal link  for more details What is group therapy  and how does it work  If your concerns are interpersonal in nature  group therapy might be the right fit for you  In a therapy group  six to eight people meet face to face with two trained group therapists and talk about what is troubling them  Members give feedback to each other by expressing their own feelings about what someone says or does  This interaction gives group members an opportunity to experiment with new ways of behaving and to learn more about the way they interact with others  What makes the situation unique is that it is a safe system  The content of the group sessions is confidential  what members talk about or disclose is not to be discussed outside the group  Members work to establish a level of trust that allows them to talk personally and honestly  Group trust is enhanced when all members make a commitment to the group When people come into a group and interact freely with other group members  they usually recreate those difficulties that brought them to group therapy in the first place  Under the skilled direction of the group therapists  the group is able to give support  offer alternatives  or gently confront one another  In this way  alternative behaviors are learned  and members develop new social techniques or ways of relating to people  During group therapy  people begin to see that they are not alone  Many people feel they are unique because of their problems  and it is encouraging to hear that other people have similar difficulties  n nUIC Logo n n n n UIC Logo  n          Counseling Center n
