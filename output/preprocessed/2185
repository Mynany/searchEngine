performed wide scholarly activities in the areas of computer vision  object and human motion recognition  image processing  neural networks and human audition  These activities resulted in more than     scientific publications  Prof  Ben Arie has successfully completed more than    research projects funded by NSF  DARPA  ARO  ONR  Whitaker Foundations and others  For his scholarly work  he received the University of Illinois Scholar award for            this is the highest research award in University of Illinois In his scientific work  he had many discoveries that resulted in broader impact on the area of image analysis  Dr  Ben Arie discovered the widely cited probabilistic peaking effects of viewed angles and distances  which is the basis of the area of probabilistic image understanding  He also developed the Affine Invariant Spectral Signatures  AISS  and the Volumetric Frequency Representation  VFR  The AISS and the VFR provide novel and efficient means for object and face recognition and shape matching Prof  Ben Arie performed research and service to the community also in the area of Image Processing where he served as an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing  In this area  he developed the non orthogonal EXpansion Matching method  EXM  which is very useful in the recognition of highly occluded objects and in motion video compression Prof  Ben Arie also specializes in the area of human motion and video databases  In this area he recently developed a breakthrough method for recognition of human activities from video based on Indexing and Sequencing  RISq  Only few sparse samples of the video are necessary for almost    % recognition  The method is a general vector sequence recognition and can be used for other applications such as speech recognition  It is currently patent pending Technical Program Committee  IEEE  Genova  Italy  Sept       Technical Program Committee  IEEE  Singapore  Oct       Research Award of the College of
