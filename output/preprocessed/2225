Laboratory  MPL  pioneered the MBE growth  characterization  and device fabrication of HgCdTe and related materials for infrared focal plane arrays  As the Director of MicroPhysics Lab  MPL  my goal has been to form a major center for heteroexptiaxy with emphasis on the study of the physics of interface formation  With internal and external support  the MPL has already become such a center for researchers  I was able to increase our funding while several major research centers related to II VI materials lost a majority of their funding  My ultimate organizational goal is to see the establishment of an interdepartmental  intercollegial Institute or Center for Materials Science and Technology with the emphasis in hetero epitaxy  I have built research collaborations with national and international universities and institutes  I strongly believe that a close interaction between university and industrial researchers is not only important for moving forward the critical technologies  but also will provide appropriate training for graduate and undergraduate students  My personal research has centered upon the molecular beam epitaxial  MBE  growth of new heteroepitaxial systems under varied growth conditions  their characterization by electrical  structural and optical measurements  and the analysis of the results of these measurements to study the interfacial growth process  For over two decades I have been conducting research in the physics of semiconductors with immediate applicability in infrared  IR  and night vision detector technology and photovoltaic solar cell technology  Semiconductor heteroepitaxy offers scientific and technological challenges because the two semiconductors on opposite sides of the heterointerface exhibit different lattice parameters  thermal expansion coefficients  and chemical bonding characteristics which can produce an electrostatic charge at the interface  These differences  and hence these challenges  are especially great for the growth of II VI semiconductors on Si substrates  which have been pioneered by the MPL  The enormity of the difficulty of growing CdTe expitaxially on Si is obvious when one considers that     the lattice constants of CdTe and Si differ by      per cent      the thermal expansion coefficients differ by almost a factor of two  and     CdTe has a large ionic component to its bonding  whereas Si bonds purely covalently  Usually  the accommodation of the lattice mismatch is achieved through interfacial dislocations  which are generated at the interface and propagate into the growing crystal  Yet  approximately the same density found in high quality bulk CdTe  This was achieved by introducing an interfacial layer  such as As  which has allowed the formation of coherent interface  The lattice mismatch was relaxed by almost perfect misfit dislocations  We were able to achieve this by careful understanding of the substrate surface and growth nucleation  At present  MPL is recognized worldwide as the academic center of excellence for the MBE growth of MCT  the study of in situ ex situ doping and transport  and the growth of high quality alternative composite CdTe Si substrates to be used for the growth of large area MCT epitaxial layers Research Interests  Experimental Condensed Matter Publications    Authored or co authored over     refereed
