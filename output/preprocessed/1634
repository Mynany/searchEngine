has been at the forefront of disability rights activism  largely due to the resistance efforts of its creative community  An exhibition at Gallery     explores this overlooked history TEXT BY CLAIRE VOON In       the Illinois Capital Development Board published a guide to setting design standards so public buildings and spaces would be barrier free for disabled persons  Accessibility Standards  Illustrated outlined requirements such as accessible entrances  curb ramps  minimal hallway widths  and other architectural codes that are ubiquitous today  Put into effect    years before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in       the guide was an early testament to the disability rights movement stirring in Illinois A major driving force behind its publication was the Chicago architect Jack Catlin  who worked closely with government figures to develop these accessibility standards  Catlin  who uses a wheelchair  is currently a partner at LCM Architects  and he exemplifies the role artists have played in pushing for disability rights and access in Chicago over the last four decades This history has largely been overlooked  Seeking to remedy that is Chicago Disability Activism  Arts  and Design      s to Today  including Accessibility Standards  Illustrated  to works by local contemporary artists like Dawoud Bey and Sky Cubacub who embrace an intersectional understanding of disability  The show also spotlights a wide variety of media  from abstract sculptures by Terrence Karpowicz  who uses a prosthetic leg  to a sound piece about navigating the CTA by Andy Slater  a blind artist  as many narratives remain in the dark  We are asking people to come with contributions for what is missing Many artists in the exhibition were part of Access Living  an organization established in      that promotes independent living for people with disabilities  It was  and still is  a key way in which disabled people found each other  The community that developed would help amplify the local disability rights movement  For practicing artists  sold  or simply appreciated  whose paintings of other disabled artists are part of the show  art schools  a dismissal  or an active hostility towards work about disability  Born with spina bifida  a condition that limited her mobility  she faced constant challenges as she navigated SAIC  The institution had no resource center then dedicated to supporting individuals with disabilities  so she and her peers had to advocate for their own needs  who is now a SAIC faculty member  and all the studios were set up for students who can stand up to paint  Parking was a nightmare  Parking is still a nightmare She found support in a small group of students  and they worked together to improve disability services at SAIC and challenge stereotypes of people with disabilities  Among them were Jude Conlon Martin  a sculptor who had a spinal cord disability  and dancer Bill Shannon  who has Legg Calve Perthes  a hip disorder  They organized student shows about impairment  spoke to curators about work that dealt with impairment  Today  SAIC has a Disability and Learning Resource Center The SAIC students were part of a growing citywide network of disability rights activists that included not only Access Living but also ADAPT  a grassroots group that sought to make urban transportation accessible   In       ADAPT held protests in Chicago to fight budget cuts to disability services and demand housing that would allow for independent living  They occupied roads  swarmed offices of the Department of Health and Human Services  and shut down the Thompson Center  the ADA was not being implemented quickly enough  and there were limitations in the way it was being implemented at the federal  state  and independent medical dimensions Instrumental in bringing ADAPT to Chicago were Mike Ervin and his partner Anna Stonum  whom Lehrer painted as part of Circle Stories  a series that commemorates disabled artists and academics entrenched in the disability rights movement  Stonum  designed  among many other things in cheek play on the evolution of man from monkey  Ervin  who has muscular dystrophy  is one of the protagonists in a documentary by Kerry Richardson  The Kids Are Alright  specifically  in the Jerry Lewis Telethon  Dawoud Bey  for one  who has severe hearing loss  photographed young women who are part of the Empowered Fefes  a support group that meets regularly at Access Living  Each large portrait is accompanied by a statement from the sitter that touches on their personal lives and why they attend this program Safe spaces and groups like Access Living have helped the development of a disability aesthetics  which Stewart describes as one that "challenges traditional modes while conflicting categories and definitions Artist Sandie Yi  who was born with two fingers and two toes on each limb  embodies this idea in her series of wearable sculptures  Crip Couture  who makes flashy  gender non conforming garments intended to draw attention to their wearers  The works are a clear departure from wearables such as prosthetics that are designed to blend in with the rest of the body  and one in which disabled individuals are more visible  Still  ableism persists  In Chicago  many still face discrimination within the local art scene  The organization Arts of Life  established in       serves as an incubator for disabled artists  providing them with studio space and a community gallery to exhibit their work  And Bodies of Work  headquartered at UIC  leads programs that give disabled artists a platform to share and celebrate their work  Since       the group has partnered with  Arts  people of color  Lehrer says  It gathers and celebrates a diverse  honest body of work by artists with disabilities  in a lot of ways  the creativity  and the weirdness Chicago Disability Activism  Arts  and Design      s to Today runs through October    at Gallery
