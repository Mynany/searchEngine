University of Illinois at Chicago has received      million in funding from the federal government to advance its work improving HIV AIDS care  prevention and education in Illinois  Indiana  Iowa  Kansas  Michigan  Minnesota  Missouri  Nebraska  Ohio and Wisconsin The funding to MATEC  is provided by two awards from the Health Resources and Services Administration  an agency of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS Ricardo Rivero  Photo  Jenny Fontaine  these awards will help us advance our mission of increasing the number of health care professionals prepared to provide high quality HIV and AIDS care to patients through the Midwest  Ricardo Rivero  who is the principal investigator of both awards One award  in the amount of      million  will enable MATEC to improve HIV AIDS training for students in medical  nursing and pharmacy schools located in all    Midwest region states  Over the course of four years  MATEC will work with accredited programs to incorporate the National HIV Curriculum e learning platform into their program requirements  either by integrating the curriculum with pre existing courses or by assisting in the development of new course offerings UIC is one of only two academic institutions in the nation to receive funding for this project Another award  in the amount of    million  The funding will establish the Midwest Fellowship for Primary Care Champions  a program designed to build capacity among primary care physicians to lead health care transformation  The program will work with a cohort of five primary care doctors each year to develop  implement and evaluate quality improvement projects in community based clinics located in Illinois  Indiana  Ohio  Michigan  Minnesota and Wisconsin  and to keep up with new information and best practices  clinical assistant professor of family medicine  nursing and medical students will seek out careers and pursue research involving HIV and AIDS topics if they remain unexposed to the topic during their medical training  This  combined with the increasing number of retiring primary care clinicians  is creating an environment in which care and prevention of HIV and AIDS are in danger of losing momentum  we hope to change this dynamic across a continuum of care providers from students and future providers to veteran practitioners who are in positions that can champion system and clinic based change Dr  Memoona Hasnain  interim head of family medicine  said the two funding awards not only complement each other  but they also dovetail with the mission of family medicine Memoona Hasnain quality patient  and family centered care  particularly for conditions like HIV  for which early detection and proactive preventive treatments to stop the spread of the virus are paramount  who is also professor of family medicine  prevention and training Rivero and Hasnain hope that with the two new grant awards MATEC and the department will inspire more students to pursue primary care and champion projects that reduce health disparities  many of which are associated with HIV AIDS  equitable  affordable  accessible and sustainable primary care in the United States is well documented  scholarship and expertise in health professions education They also hope that in the long term these projects will improve HIV AIDS outcomes through the Midwest region  which vary across its    states  but the biggest challenges are the perpetuating stigma of the condition and the social challenges  like poverty  housing and transportation  experienced by many of those affected by HIV quality primary care  but to mitigate the damage of these social challenges and this stigmatization among communities and other providers  HIV prevalence varies MATEC  which was established at UIC in       More information about the program is available online at matec info  and more information about the department of family medicine is available online at chicago medicine
