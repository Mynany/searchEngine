Associated Press Stylebook for additional guidance UIC Style Guidelines Associated Press Stylebook Content Creation   Maintenance In order for content to be useful  usable  accessible and findable  we must deliberately plan for the full lifecycle of content and services and build in assessment at each step  This lifecycle and the workflows involved in each phase are outlined below  Content and services can range from small scale projects  such as the addition of a new section on a web page  to large scale content review and revision for an individual site Content Lifecycle The planning process can take anywhere from a few minutes for a small blurb on a web page  to a few months or years for a large scale web project If content does not meet content design principles or if there is no longer a primary stakeholder to manage it  it will be withdrawn Content roles Content authors directly edit content on a web property  They are required to uphold the Content Strategy and Web Style Guide  and participate in regular content assessment  Content authors must also complete a minimum level of training in writing for the web and using the content management platform on which they create content Within a web property  content authors may have different levels of roles and permissions  and some authors may have additional editorial responsibilities to approve and publish the work of other authors  Content authors may also have different roles in different web properties Content author roles are set by the site owner Every piece of content should have a content owner who is responsible for maintaining it through its full lifecycle  A web property owner assigns content ownership  If a department  committee or working group is the content owner  the chair or head will be ultimately responsible for the content Web property owners lead efforts to maintain and create all content on the site  They set content authoring permissions  assign ownership of content  and lead regular content review efforts  A site owner may be one person or the chairs of a working group or committee Writing Goals   Principles Guiding principles for the UIC web presence are  Focusing on the User User needs drive all of the content and services that make up the web presence  All web content and services are regularly assessed through user testing and use data  Areas of the web presence that do not meet the standards of our users are retired or improved Inclusion The web presence respects and builds upon the varied skills  backgrounds  and experiences of its diverse users through inclusive language and services  The tone of all web content should be friendly and easily understandable to a diverse audience Fairness to all The web presence works to ensure equal access to information by providing services that meet or exceed standards for accessibility and usability Researched Methods The web presence operates on evidence based best practices and original research with our users Thinking outside the box The web presence employs innovative new services and information practices that improve the online delivery of Library resources and services to our users Public Relations The web presence consists of services that engage with users and collaborators in the University  in Chicago  and with communities throughout the State  the Midwest region  and beyond User Data Security Writing For The Web Why is writing for the web different  How to have a conversation with users For each piece of content  ask  Structure your content so that users can find the answers to their questions quickly  Summarize the essential information first  then reveal the information that supports it Other general guidelines Voice   Tone Our voice is our unique personality  so should the voice of our web presence  A well crafted voice communicates our personality and values UIC Style Guide under Lexicon Determine tone through context  so can the tone of writing used throughout our web presence To connect with people and show you care  you have to meet your users where they are  Think about the situation your readers are in  What did they come here for  Blog posts can be personal and casual  you probably need to take on an instructional tone  You can be a little more dramatic or persuasive in a marketing campaign than in your help center Above all  consider the context of the message  For example  you can naturally assume that readers need help finding their way  Try to understand their frame of mind and talk to them where they are  Find out what happens just before your message appears  Is this good news that will make readers feel happy  relieved  or excited  or is it bad news that will make them frustrated  angry  or upset  Will the message brighten their day  or put them in a difficult situation  Are readers prepared  or will they be caught off guard  These questions will help you decide how to write the message Writing About People from the MailChimp Content Style Guide MailChimp Content Style Guide Remember  words matter Additional information on the power of language is provided by the UIC Office of Diversity UIC Office of Diversity Chronological References  If it is relevant  offset by commas  The CEO      just got her drivers license Accommodating All People  If you need to mention it When writing about a person with disabilities Gender Requirements Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives Use the following words as modifiers  but never as nouns  When writing about a person  use their preferred pronouns  just use their name Acronym Explained Acceptable in all references for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  or lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender and questioning and or queer  In quotations and the formal names of organizations and events  other forms such as LGBTQIA  and other variations are also acceptable with the other letters explained  I generally stands for intersex  and A can stand for allies  a person who is not LGBT but who actively supports the LGBT community  asexual   or both  The plus represents other identities that may fall under the umbrella The word queer has been reclaimed by many LGBTQIA  communities  but may be considered a slur in some contexts  so limit use of the word to quotes and names of organizations  following rules for obscenities  profanities  vulgarities as appropriate  Note that sex  gender and sexual orientation are not synonymous Writing for Deaf People Detailing an individual with a medical condition  use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first Detailing Psychological definitions  Never assume that someone has a medical  mental  or cognitive condition  use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first Writing for Blind people and those with low vision Web Elements Alt text Alt text is a way to label images  Alt text should describe the image in a brief sentence or two Buttons Buttons should always contain actions  The language should be clear and concise  Capitalize every word  including articles Standard website buttons include  Checkboxes Use sentence case for checkboxes Drop down menus Use title case for menu names and sentence case for menu items Forms Form titles should clearly and quickly explain the purpose of the form Use title case for form titles and sentence case for form fields Keep forms as short as possible Only request information that we need and intend to use  including gender  If you need to ask for gender  provide a field the user can fill in on their own  not a drop down menu When writing microcopy on forms  i e explanatory or instructional text that accompanies fields  be clear and concise  Microcopy should lend direction  Consider writing it an opportunity to further build a relationship with the user Headings and subheadings Headings and subheadings organize content for readers  Be generous and descriptive Headings  H   Use them for page and blog titles Subheadings  H   H   etc  break articles into smaller  more specific sections  They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable Headings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy  with heading first  followed by subheadings in order   An H  will nestle under H   an H  under H   and on down Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings  and make sure you cover the main point of the content Use title case for titles  H   unless the heading is a punctuated sentence  If the heading is a punctuated sentence  use sentence case Use sentence case  H   H   etc  for subheadings regardless of end punctuation Links  Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources a  an  the  our  when you link text  For example  Yes  Read the automation guide for details No  Read the automation guide for details If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma  and link relevant keywords Links should look different than regular copy  strong text  or emphasis text  and should have a distinct active and visited state Numbered   Bulleted Lists Use lists to present steps  groups  or sets of information  Give context for the list with a brief introduction  Number lists when the order is important If one of the list items is a complete sentence  use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items  If list items are not complete sentences  but do capitalize the first word of each item Navigation Your main or global navigation is used to guide site visitors around your website  It should contain ONLY internal links to your site pages  External links to other websites  including other UIC sites  can appear in eyebrow or footer menus  but not your main global navigation menu Use title case for main or global navigation  Use sentence case for subnavigation Navigation links should be clear and concise Radio Buttons Use title case for headings and sentence case for button fields Related articles Linked articles should appear in a logical order  following the step down step up rule  The first article should be a step down in complexity from the current article  The second one should be a step up in complexity to a more advanced article Titles Titles organize pages and guide readers  A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows Titles are  you guessed it  in title case UIC Specific Terms Use these terms
