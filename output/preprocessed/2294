Students Giving Back to the Community through Senior Design Projects Home         And    students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  are taking this mission to heart and using their engineering knowledge and skills to help four Chicago nonprofits Under the direction of ECE Clinical Assistant Professor Renata A  Revelo  the students partnered with Enlace Chicago  Lakeview Pantry  Little Village Environmental Justice Organization  and People for Community Recovery to give back to local nonprofit agencies that are supporting Chicago residents  but the projects will take them to areas throughout Chicago The nonprofits provided a problem statement  during the spring      semester  the students along with the organizations  worked to refine the problem statement and develop a solution  At the end of the semester  the teams presented their ideas to the organizations based organizations and college students  Doing the project in the community will give them real world experience Enlace Chicago The team of Emmanuel Leon  Deep Shah  Hemant Rawat and Allen Chavez are developing NeoSnap for Enlace Chicago Enlace is dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of the residents of the Little Village community by fostering a physically safe and healthy environment and by championing opportunities for educational advancement and economic development Using a photo booth app has allowed Enlace to engage the community by making its events interactive and fun  The program is great for marketing  too  Unfortunately  the program will no longer be maintained by the developer and the maintenance costs are too high Instead of losing an important tool  the ECE students introduced NeoSnap  It is a dedicated photo booth device that will take pictures of people and allow users to upload to a social media site of their choosing or print the pictures  the team plans to turn it into an educational tool  too  The ECE students will provide the organization with a user manual so users of all skill levels can operate it and even create a replica of the device  The students want NeoSnap to foster interest in the STEM field for students in the Little Village community Lakeview Pantry The team of Jody Randhawa  Jake Wang  Kevin Puetz and Matt Kaczmarczyk are partnering with the Lakeview Pantry to streamline its inventory system  increasing the independence of its clients through self help initiatives and other innovative programs  and raising awareness of hunger and poverty and working toward solutions to eliminate them The pantry lacks a computerized inventory system  and relies on pencil  paper and an estimate of how much food they have or will require in the future  They have deemed this a growing issue as they plan to expand their operations To address the issue  the ECE students are constructing QWIC  Quantitative Weight Indication Contraption  which will provide a quick  easy and seamless way for a user to obtain accurate  real time data on how much food  in terms of weight  is present on a shelf  The system will record the shelf weight daily and have the data accessible for further calculations or accounting With QWIC  the pantry will have an updated system  which will allow them to focus more time on the eradication of hunger and poverty Little Village Environmental Justice Organization The team of Anastasios Kokkinias  Juan Abrego  Charalambos Nicolaou and Miguel Hernandez proposed the Grecos lantern system for the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization  LVEJO determination of immigrant  low income  and working class families  Its vision is to build a sustainable community that promotes the healthy development of youth and families  provides economic justice  and practices participatory democracy and self determination The organization has a garden that acts as a community hub and event space  Unfortunately  the space does not have lighting and activity ends when the sun sets To help LVEJO get more out of the garden  the students are recommending its Grecos lantern system  which will provide the necessary lighting to extend the time of activities The system will be comprised of a charging dock with wireless transmitters  The lanterns will rest upon it and the built in wireless receivers will charge the batteries  Additionally People for Community Recovery The team of Roxane Vitorillo  Carlos Ramirez  Nikolay Stepin and Dominick Przybylo are working with the People for Community Recovery  PCR  on the South Side of Chicago  It educates and advocates policy and programs in an effort to coordinate local residents on issues of the environment  health  housing  neighborhood safety  and economic equity PCR wants to build a museum and training and research facilities to promote green energy and a cleaner environment  reduce the crime rate among the youth in the community  attract researchers  and provide a means for additional educational and professional opportunities to the community  The students are reviewing energy consumption  the life cycle costs of HVAC  lights  and hot water  They also are evaluating the payback of various renewable energy sources or green energy solutions like photovoltaic solar panels  wind turbines  and high efficiency appliances  Revelo sees this as an opportunity for the students to give back to the community while building stronger relationships between the ECE department and local organizations  Her goal is to increase the number of partnerships each year  Rashid Ansari  ECE Department Head Throughout the fall      semester  the students will implement the projects  and they are slated to present the projects during a mini expo at the end of the semester  visit https
