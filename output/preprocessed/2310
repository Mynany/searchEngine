Q  Revelo Home        ECE is a growing department with several new faculty members  In the second part of this series we are introducing Clinical Assistant Professor Renata A  Revelo How did you become interested in engineering  My uncle inspired me to consider engineering  He would set up circuit and computer programming experiments for me and my sister to explore  It was wonderful seeing how engaged he was in what he was doing that it inspired me to do the same  This inspiration was reinforced during high school when I took a programming class and an engineering drafting class What experiences led you to your present position  Before I decided to pursue engineering education as a research interest  I was involved in a summer program where I developed academic curriculum for an engineering class and then taught the class  In that same program  I developed programmatic curriculum for an orientation piece of the program  Both of those experiences made me think about all the programs that I had been involved in as a student and how formative and essential they had been for my success  Working as a professor allows me to interact with students  Through my work with the college of engineering to Can you tell us about your work as a professor in ECE  Could you describe a typical work day  Right now  my typical work day consists of class preparation  developing innovating the strategies I use in class to deliver material  On average  I spend some time writing  most of which are papers that stem from my dissertation work Have you received any awards or recognition  What are your secrets that lead you to receiving them   The first is an award for outstanding service as a graduate mentor  Being able to work with students one on one is extremely rewarding  Being recognized for the work by the students was humbling and exciting  My secret would be to put yourself in a place where you can thrive and you enjoy what you are doing  The second award was a best paper award at a conference  I was not prepared to receive that award What are your favorite hardware and software tools  Matlab used to be a favorite  Nowadays  I am really getting into R  so R  reminds me of my programming days and that makes me want to keep using it  I use R for statistical analysis Are you involved with any professional organizations   American Society for Engineering Education  and Association for the Study of Higher Education  Without SHPE  Today  I am part of a national committee that works on a middle school and high school symposium focused on STEM that is part of the national SHPE conference What are you currently working on  Collaborating with colleagues on research projects dealing with engineering education and the culture of engineering Do you have an area of engineering that you specialize in  Engineering education  culture of engineering  success of underrepresented students in engineering  and engineering identity What do you do during your free time  Photography  walking  visiting new places  close and far What direction do you see yourself in a few years from now  Or what would you like to accomplish at UIC  Working with engineering students closely  either through teaching or programs or both  Working on engineering education research  At UIC  I would like to work on how engineering students identify as engineers through their classes and involvement I would have loved to be a dancer  I can only dream By David Staudacher  UIC David Staudacher   Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus    Linkedin    Tumblr    Email
