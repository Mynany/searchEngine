Series Sorin Istrail Abstract  GRN Academic Press       Eric Davidson  the foremost experimentalist of regulatory genomics  forcefully reminds us that in the scientific method  causality is everything  all other approaches are just distractions  In contrast  Davidson aligns with them  adding to their argument a practical dose of reality  The exquisite regulatory mechanisms  locked down by evolution  can only be revealed through systematic experimental perturbations  no amount of clustering statistics  or other skinny deep dives  and with the sea urchin genome in hand  Eric Davidson become the leading liberator of quantitative principles of cell regulation  trapped in the qualitative  descriptive world of biology without genomic sequence In this talk we will discuss several computer science problems  inspired by our    years long collaboration with Professor Davidson  who died in       and rooted in his seminal research on causality  completeness  genomic Boolean logic  and genomically encoded regulatory information  Our collaboration produced the CYRENE cisGRN Lexicon database containing the regulatory architecture of      transcription factor encoding genes and other regulatory genes in eight species  human  mouse  fruit fly  sea urchin  nematode  rat  chicken  and zebrafish  and the CYRENE cisGRN Browser  a full genome browser dedicated to cis regulatory genomics  papers and six books  he mentored about     Ph D s  postdocs and faculty in his laboratory in the Division of Biology at California Institute of Technology  He was also a beacon of critical discourse  In this spirit  As our beloved teacher and mentor  physicists  biochemists  engineers  mathematicians and computer scientists  From such research will ultimately come  by experimental demonstration  the revelation of the much sought laws of regulatory Biology Biography  Sorin Istrail is the Julie Nguyen Brown Professor of Computational and Mathematical Sciences and Professor of Computer Science at Brown University  He is the former Director of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown University  Before joining Brown  he was the Senior Director and then Head of Informatics Research at Celera Genomics  where his group played a central role in the construction of the Sequence of the Human Genome  they co  with over        citations to date  is one of the most cited scientific paper  His group at Celera Genomics also built a powerful suite of genome wide algorithms that was used for the comparison of all human genome assemblies to date   In      he joined the ranks of Applied Biosystems Science Fellows  one of just six Science Fellows in a company of     scientists   Before Celera  Professor Istrail founded and led the Computational Biology Project at Sandia National Laboratories              In       he obtained the negative solution  computational intractability  of a    years old unresolved problem in statistical mechanics  the Three Dimensional Ising Model Problem  This work was included in the Top     Most Important Discoveries of the U S  and as the  th top achievement of DOE in Advanced Scientific Computing  human genetics and genome wide associations studies  medical bioinformatics of autism  multiple sclerosis  HIV  preterm labor and viral immunology  algorithms and computational complexity  and statistical physics  In      he co  Romania  He is Editor in Chief of the Journal of Computational Biology  and together with Pavel Pevzner and Mike Waterman  he is co Editor of the MIT Press Computational Molecular Biology series and is co Editor of the Springer Verlag Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics series  Iasi  Romania Sorin Istrail obtained his PhD in Computer Science from University of Bucharest having his beloved professors Solomon Marcus and Sergiu Rudeanu as his PhD advisors  He did his postdoctoral studies in computer science with Professor Albert Meyer of the Laboratory of Computer Science  MIT  He also did his postdoctoral studies in Molecular Biology with Professor Eric Davidson of the Division of Biology at California Institute of Technology Google Calendar Ical Export Related Events Maria Klawe Seminar
