PhD students He was very proud of the gallery of portraits in his GEAR Research Center  Those were scientists that he felt contributed significantly to the field of mechanical engineering and believed deserved recognition  though some of them maybe never got it during their life time With great enthusiasm and diligence  he was searching those names and biographies  sometimes contacting relatives in the  rd generation  causing astonishment  surprise  and often a significant appreciation and gratitude That became a chapter in his book Professor Litvin was a distinguished man  wise  cultured
