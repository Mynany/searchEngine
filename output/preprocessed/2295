     A team of ECE students brought home a handful of awards for their senor design project  The team of Anthony Bertini  Dennis Goad  Nataliya Belyaeva  and Ryan Maurella were one of only two teams to win The Office of Technology Management Award for Innovation during the   th Annual UIC Engineering Senior Design Expo on April           at the UIC Forum      W  Roosevelt Road  Chicago  The team picked up the award and      for their project Erebus  Automatic Gunfire Detection System The team also received a first place Globe Award for the project  During the expo  the students competed against     projects  which were presented by more than     students The Erebus system is a device that will automatically recognize a gunshot and contact the authorities just like a fire alarm  The system continuously monitors sound levels and infrared light signatures  Using this data  it will determine if a gun has been fired  With the use of quick reference LED indicators There are outdoor gunshot detection systems available  but these systems use a triangulation method to pinpoint a shooter and have limited effectiveness indoors  Our proposed solution would be fully functional indoor system that effectively uses dual sampling to identify a gunshot Additional projects to win Globe Awards at the expo included CAN based Traction Control for SAE Formula Car  Design of an Automatic Ping Pong Scoreboard Second Place Honorable Mention projects were IOT Portable Climate Controller  Solar Tracking and Monitoring  and Sleep Alert New Priemer Senior Design Award Earlier in the school year  the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering awarded the inaugural Priemer Senior Design Award to four senior design teams The award  which is named after the donor and ECE Associate Professor Emeritus Roland Priemer  All of the teams demonstrated the potential for an exceptional design project The winners were Dennis Goad  Nataliya Beliayeva  Ryan Maurella  and Anthony Bertini for the Erebus  Automatic Gunfire Detection System  see description above   Giovanni Martinez and Daniel Diaz for Product Name LayZe  Nikola Jovic  Irineo Medina  Roderick Pahati  Genaro Rodriguez  and Andrzej Wsol for Smart Board Rack  and Matthew Goralka  Daniel Lauritzen  Steven Leib  and Nicholas  Zachary for Triplexer The purpose of Product Name LayZe is to create an efficient and cost effective radio controlled lawn mower for people who cannot or do not want to operate heavy machinery  The team designed it so anyone can use the machine without any more preparation than reading the user manual  The user interface is simple with buttons for basic commands and connectivity  and the lawn mower has wireless capabilities  which will allow for a remote control to be connected to the lawn mower term goal for this project is for the lawn mower to be completely autonomous  This will allow the mower to inform the user of when the grass needs to be cut and the user must do is set a schedule The goal of Smart Board Rack is to implement public board racks to provide an ideal solution to skateboard storage and theft prevention  Smart cards will ensure only registered users can interact with the rack  A mechanical locking mechanism per board slot will ensure each skateboard is properly secured  If a would The aim of The Triplexer  Expressive Musical Foot Controller project is to develop a foot controller that allows for intuitive  simultaneous and independent control over three musical parameters using only one foot sized platform using load cells  and an embedded system allows user configurable scaling and routing of that information to outputs compatible with MIDI or Open Sound Control over USB  In many cases  The Triplexer device may be used as a direct replacement for existing pedals  but with simultaneous multi parameter control  which has a wide range of potential applications By David Staudacher  UIC David Staudacher   Facebook    Twitter
