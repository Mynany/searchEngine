Students finding early success as Freshmen Home         Engineers are problem solvers FESP  and it is designed to motivate and support students with their studies  It also rewards them with a guaranteed paid internship at the end of the year The program  now in its third year  consists of a series of sessions and group projects encouraging students to learn more about their discipline and how to build an engineering sense by using their existing math and science skills  Throughout the year  the students participate in at least two general sessions  two team based mini projects separated by major  and are introduced to the wide array of resources at UIC to help them achieve academic success  Additional support comes from required tutoring sessions with by undergraduate engineering students who are dedicated to helping engineering freshmen in their math and science coursework throughout the year  a Clinical Associate Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  while teaching them about engineering and all the different fields it encompasses Throughout the year the students will gain a better understanding of what it means to be an engineer  and learn more insight about the coursework over the next four years  They will learn from the faculty and have the opportunity to talk to them one on one  which is geared toward helping them get know and feel comfortable approaching faculty members with questions  they will use a computer simulation tool or use Matlab to create something  These are freshmen taking fundamental classes  but this program will introduce them to engineering tools and terminology or jargon Apart from providing students with projects and tutors  the program introduces students to the professional workplace  FESP coincides with an orientation class that teaches the students how to write a resume  discuss what to expect during an interview  and have the opportunity to learn from industry professionals who visit the campus for speaking engagements  provide tips about working in groups  time management  and more  We are providing them with the professional tools to succeed in their courses and in the real world  These are things that are not usually taught in classes  which was one of the first things  and they covered interviewing  a junior in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department  And for the interviews  they discussed what type of questions to expect and how to prepare  how to dress  and the basics  which is important  who shared their work experiences  too  It gives you more direction and introduces you to all the parts of the industry Gaining Real World Experience Students who successfully complete the FESP requirements and maintain a GPA of     or greater during the first and second semester qualify for the Guaranteed Paid Internship Program  GPIP  during the summer that follows their freshman year The freshmen are placed in engineering firms in the Chicago area or in a research laboratory at UIC  where they are exposed to real world engineering practices  build relationships with industry professionals and college professors  and gain valuable experience  In its first two years  more than     freshmen have participated in the program and worked summer internships Richter is among the students who have benefited from the program  After his freshman year  he participated in the Guaranteed Paid Internship Program  GPIP  and landed a three month summer internship at Knowles Corporation  I was working with the MEMS  Micro Electronic Mechanical Systems on experience and my mentors let me get my hands dirty  The work is very different from school work While interning at Knowles  Richter remembered what he learned in FESP and created a LinkedIn profile highlighting his work at the company  This move led to more opportunities after his sophomore year  I was contacted by an Apple recruiter who asked me if I would like to try out for one of the five teams available After a couple of phone interviews  Richter was offered a paid internship at Apple in California  He started in January      and worked on the Audio Electrical Engineering team for seven months  While he gained more experience  he also came back with more than work experience  my confidence shot up through the roof  and it was a big barrier I had to break Today  the UIC junior is in Chicago working on his degree  and he already has another internship lined up with Apple  According to Richter  the projects are top secret  like most people  and it is all within my field More information about the programs can be found at Internship Program Internship Program   Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus    Linkedin    Tumblr    Email
