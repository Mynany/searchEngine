Engineering at UIC  Our department is located just outside the vibrant downtown of Chicago and near major hubs for ground  rail and air transportation  The metropolitan Chicago is home to a large number of industries that interact with our faculty and employ our graduates We offer BS  MS  and Ph D degrees in each of the disciplines of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering  We also offer a BS degree in Engineering Management and a unique Masters of Energy Engineering designed for working professionals  These programs are supported by    tenured or tenure track professors and several additional teaching and research faculty and by substantial annual research funding to support graduate students in their works as researchers in one of our    research labs Mechanical engineering is one of the oldest fields of engineering  yet it is constantly evolving through its applications in emerging areas  Today  mechanical engineers are not only trained in traditional fields such as fluid mechanics  heat transfer  machine design  and controls  but they also learn how to apply the fundamental principles from physics  chemistry and mathematics to exciting modern fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology  Mechanical engineering is also one of the broadest fields of engineering and its graduates find jobs in various industries such as energy  aerospace  manufacturing  robotics  and medical devices  just to name a few Industrial Engineering is concerned with the analysis  design  improvement  and installation of integrated systems of people  material  information  equipment  and energy  Industrial Engineering is where engineering meets business  Industrial engineers are specially trained to eliminate practices that waste time  money  energy and other resources  Graduates in industrial engineering can work in almost any industry  including manufacturing  healthcare  logistics  transportation  finance  electronics  entertainment and many others In addition to our outstanding faculty  funding  and computational and experimental resources  our department provides a congenial atmosphere for undergraduate and graduate studies and for collaborative work with industry and other academic partners  I encourage you to learn as much as you can about our programs  Visit the department and look over our faculty research profiles on our website  talk to our faculty  and meet with our students  I hope you will find that MIE offers the breadth and vision in its undergraduate  graduate  and collaborative programs that you seek  and I invite you to consider becoming a part of this talented and dynamic community The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering The Department of Mechanical   Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago is committed to excellence in research  teaching  and service to the community University of Illinois at Chicago  Mechanical Engineering is essential to a wide range of activities that include the design  development  manufacture  management  and control of engineering systems  subsystems  and their components  Typically the manufacturing  power  aerospace  automotive  materials  and processing industries employ mechanical engineers  As a result of the recent rapid expansion of technology  mechanical engineers also have become increasingly involved in computer aided design and visualization  robotics  bioengineering  environmental engineering  solar  wind  and ocean energy sources  and space exploration  The breadth of the field provides the graduate with many possibilities for a satisfying career Currently  there are more than    professors of national and international stature actively engaged in research areas at the leading edge of technology whom have degrees from prestigious universities across the country  Faculty are involved in many research areas including nMEMS  Microelectrical Mechanical Systems  virtual reality  combustion  environmental science  thermal science  dynamics and control  mechatronics  bioengineering  manufacturing and processing  The Department s comprehensive five year research budget is approximately    M and is comprised of funding primarily from government agencies and industry via grants  contracts and gifts  The large number of major archival journals and reference books published and edited by the faculty also enhances the reputation of the Department The Department of Mechanical   Industrial Engineering offers comprehensive programs leading to the degrees of B S  M S  and Ph D  in Mechanical Engineering  Industrial Engineering and related disciplines  UIC is one of    Research I Universities in the United States and is a widely recognized center for international education and research  Frequently  faculty members include students at both the graduate and undergraduate level in research programs and interactions with industry  Students gain first hand exposure to real world engineering problems which  along with their classroom and laboratory work  makes them attractive candidates to many employers after graduation The Department is housed in a new     million Engineering Research Facility which combines state of the art research laboratories  including a Class     Clean Room  two Virtual Reality CAVE theatres  a comprehensive MEMS research center  advanced CAD CAM and computer lab
