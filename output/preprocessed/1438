Students Research and Teaching Assistantships n There are three forms of financial aid  Fellowships  Assistantships  Research and Teaching  and Tuition and Fee Waivers  Research assistantships are assigned by a particular faculty member from their own research funding on an individual basis  and are generally given to students of longer tenure who are more disposed to perform in depth research  Teaching assistants normally aid professors in large courses by handling laboratory and discussion sections and grading papers  The Graduate Secretary distributes forms at the beginning of each semester for those students who wish to be considered for a teaching assistantship and or a tuition and fee waiver for the upcoming semester  A sample TA Application form is given in Appendix    With rare exceptions  students can hold a teaching assistantship for no more than four semesters The criteria for assigning teaching assistantships are as follows  barbara boockmeier uic edu Tuition and Fee Waivers n Waivers are awarded by the Graduate College  not by the Department  As with University Fellowships  the competition is University wide  The Department submits names of students  the number not to exceed   % of total graduate student enrollment  who are unlikely to receive another form of financial aid  It has been this Department s experience that no more than two or three students are initially awarded waivers and perhaps one more student may receive a waiver sometime later in the year  As mentioned above  if an assistantship has been received in the spring semester  a waiver will carry through the summer  Students given tuition and fee waivers  including teaching and research assistantships  must register for at least   hours of credit during the fall and spring semesters  and three hours during the summer semester  The Graduate Committee continuously reviews the record and progress of every graduate student  All appointments are conditional on satisfactory performance National  State  and University Fellowships n Graduate fellowships are awarded both to incoming students  as a recruiting tool  and to encourage outstanding continuing students to pursue Ph  D  research  They are awarded by the Graduate College  not by the Department  or by other agencies outside the University  A student can apply to any Fellowship for which the conditions are met  if more than the allotted numbers of applications are received for a particular fellowship  the Graduate Committee decides which are sent in  A general calendar of currently available fellowships and their approximate monthly deadlines are listed in the table below  UNDERGRADUATE LINKS  College of Engineering Scholarships  Office of Special Scholarship Programs  Office of Student Financial Aid  n
