Modifies Curriculum to Improve Student Experience Home        The world is constantly changing  and to ensure our students are getting the best education that will prepare them for graduate school or the working world  the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  enhanced its curriculum with several positive changes  Computer Engineering  and Engineering Physics  and we decided to think in terms of labs  experience for students  and whether the course content was up to date with all that is going on in technology these days  The changes are about making sure the classes are up to date to provide the best experience for students  The revisions remove redundancy  and outdated or unnecessary content  It also introduced new classes  For example  Instead students should have a single computer organization course and  in addition  an introduction to embedded systems  which are pervasive in electronics today  ECE     was removed  ECE     revamped  along other Computer Engineering classes  and a new class created  with number ECE      In the new curriculum on labs  practical experience  and something they can really use as a skill when they apply for jobs  This is just one example of how the faculty reviewed all the courses and decided to update some of them  so students will be able to not just see the concepts in theory  but also to practice on them  This will help students to get internships because they are learning practically relevant skills  The department also adjusted some of the requirements in basic math and science  which are based on changes in the courses offered by other departments to ensure all three ECE degree programs conform with the ABET accreditation criteria  the changes will free up some hours in the curriculum  which will allow room for extra engineering credits  This is one of the big changes in the new curriculum  At present  students could choose to take four ECE courses out of a list of six courses  With the elimination of one course from the department offering and by designating another one as Technical Elective  the remaining four courses will become mandatory  This was possible without increasing the number of credit hours needed for graduation because credit hours were freed up due to the changes in the basic math and science requirements  which will give them a more rounded foundation  Electrical Engineering students will get exposure to signal processing  communication  control  and solid state devices  Based on knowing the different aspects of electrical engineering  students will make a better informed decision when choosing their technical electives at the     level  The faculty made similar changes to the Computer Engineering program  Upon review  the faculty discovered some of the classes had hidden prerequisite classes in Computer Science and it was difficult for ECE students to take those classes  we decided that the hidden prerequisites should be gone  and we shortened the prerequisite chain  Apart from the faculty  curriculum changes incorporate feedback and suggestions from partners outside of UIC  The ECE department received feedback from its external advisory board  which is made up of industry professionals and alumni members  The faculty also looked at recommendations and feedback they received from ABET during the      accreditation cycle  The curriculum work will be an ongoing project  The faculty recommended it to be under review to ensure it is always up to date  This will allow to make gradual changes  instead of major ones  down the road  such as Big Data  For any questions about the curriculum changes  please contact your student advisor  To learn more about the ECE Department and curriculum  visit www ece uic edu www ece uic
