Program scientists  MD PhD graduates are positioned to bridge the basic and clinical sciences  and to pursue interdisciplinary approaches to important biomedical problems  Compared to other scientists  MD PhDs have deeper perceptions of medical significance in biology  greater ability to transfer basic scientific advances toward patient care advances  and more comprehensive understanding of the limitations in current medical practice  Compared to other physicians  MD PhD graduates stand out for their scientific insight into bedside problems  their ability to educate succeeding generations of students  and as innovative champions of progress in medicine About Our Program In response to the need for accomplished academic medical scientists  the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine offers a combined training program that leads to both the MD and the PhD degrees  The objective of the Program is to train students for careers in academic medicine and research  The Program integrates the medical curriculum with graduate studies in the basic medical sciences  During this time  they explore research opportunities in any academic department of the College of Medicine  including Anatomy and Cell Biology  Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics  Microbiology   Immunology  Neuroscience  Pharmacology  and Physiology   Biophysics  or in a non  Bio engineering  School of

Timetable Seminar Series Financial Aid Advising Timetable Timetable The Medical Scientist Training Program requires seven to eight years of study  During this time students explore research opportunities in various academic departments under the guidance of their appointed faculty advisors  They are required to complete three research rotations of   to   weeks each during this time Selection of a permanent thesis advisor and commitment to a graduate department take place by the end of the second year of study  MD PhD students then enter into their chosen graduate department and complete coursework from a set of introductory GEMS courses  as well as  more advanced courses in their research specialties  Under the guidance of a member of the research faculty  students spend three to four years engaged in an extensive period of original doctoral research  They are required to complete all of the departmental requirements for the PhD degree before returning to the medical school curriculum  During the PhD phase  They may also volunteer at the weekly student run free clinic GEMS In the final   years of the Program  MD PhD candidates rejoin the medical school class to complete the remaining medical school requirements  Individual modifications of the above timetable to meet specific needs and interests can be developed Seminar Series Seminar Series A series of lunch seminars  provides an overview of the opportunities for research  Also  an ongoing series of dinner seminars is presented to MD PhD students in all stages of the program by physician scientists from UIC as well as other medical schools  help to develop new approaches in biomedical research  and expose students to research areas of special interest to physician scientists  The seminar series is one of several means used to bring together trainees and preceptors from the various programs Financial Aid Financial Aid MD PhD students receive a tuition waiver and stipend throughout all years of the Program  For the           academic year  the annual stipend is         for each year of medical studies and graduate studies  Most student fees are also paid by the COM or other sources Advising Advising To address the special educational needs of MD PhD students and the psychological emotional problems that can results from particular stresses that occur at various stages of MD PhD studies  the UIC MSTP has a multi pronged effort to counsel students to prevent problems occurring in difficult situations of each educational stage and to remediate such problems as quickly as possible if they do occur  This multi faceted approach relies on two permanent anchors of support for all students at all times      The mutual experiences within cohorts bolstered by the strong feelings of camaraderie that are the special feature of our program community  and     the use of the program directors  who know the students best and are fully aware of their needs  as first counselors advisors  three types of advising counseling activities take place throughout each academic year specific meetings to discuss educational issues relevant to that cohort student meetings to address issues of universal concern and allow for sharing of advice between more and less advanced cohorts  Dr  Larry Tobacman  Associate Directors  Dr  Nancy Freitag and Dr  Mark Rosenblatt In addition to these organized  scheduled events  all students are welcome to meet with any or all of the directors at any time to discuss anything on their mind  Strict confidentiality will always be maintained and referrals to more knowledgeable authorities will be made when needed For Further Information Contact  Julie Mann  Director of Program Administration      CMW  MC           W  Polk St
