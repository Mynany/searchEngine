Students Support Graduate Education You are here Home Petitions Graduate College policies and procedures regarding students were developed by the faculty and the staff of the College to maintain academic standards  to ensure equitable assessment and treatment of students  and to monitor and record their progress in an efficient manner  Occasionally students have legitimate reasons for requesting exceptions to policies and procedures  and the petition process allows them to formally state their cases The petition process is not a vehicle for students to fix problems they  or the department  have created by not knowing or following policies and procedures  Rather  it should be used by students who  for reasons beyond their control  have not been able to meet requirements  and who have an educationally sound alternative means of meeting the spirit  if not the letter  of the policy or procedure  The intention of the Graduate College faculty when the rule was adopted is the guiding principle in the review of a petition at the College level Petitions are normally reviewed at three levels  some require more  The advisor  acting as the College s closest representative to the student is the first judge of whether or not a request is reasonable and fair given his her knowledge of the student s situation  The DGS is then asked to evaluate the request within the context of the program and his her understanding of the philosophy of the Graduate College  The Graduate College  which  of necessity  has a wider scope  then adds its perspective on the issue  When the College administration feels that the request is a major violation of College standards  or that it is unjustifiably unfair to other students  it reserves the right to deny the request The intent of the College in this three part process is to reinforce  not weaken  the relationship of the student to the DGS and program  and to underscore the College s assumption that Directors of Graduate Studies provide active oversight and continuous mentoring of students in regards to degree progress and program compliance  In this same vein  the College also understands that DGS support of a petition will be based on procedural and pedagogic concerns carefully considered by the DGS and expressed in forwarding petitions  On the other hand  it expects that the DGS will withhold support when appropriate In cases where the Graduate College approves petitions  it does so only with the strong endorsement of the advisor and DGS  and where appropriate  the instructor of a course  In so doing  it sees the DGS as the advocate of the student in relation to the petition  The Graduate College closely reviews the justification  or lack of  provided by the advisor  and  most importantly  the DGS  to help formulate a decision  The DGS can speak to program issues as well as to the specific situation of the student  Consequently  the Graduate College will not discuss the disposition of a petition with the student alone  Discussion should be initiated by the DGS  or an appointment may be set up with the DGS  the student and the appropriate Graduate College dean Graduate Student Petition Except for a leave of absence or for transfer credit  which have their own forms  students should use the Graduate Student Petition for all other situations  both of which are Office of Registration and Records  ORR  forms   Leave of Absence See Leave of Absence Leave of Absence Petition to Register After the Registration Deadline  ORR form Students are allowed to register and make course adjustments

are strongly discouraged  as students have ample time to make corrections and should not be allowed to make adjustments after finals have begun  in rare instances where this situation arises  the student must complete the Petition for Retroactive Registation or Course Add and a Graduate College Registration Revision Form  including exceptions where this form is not to be used  and which office must sign and approve the request Dropping and Adding Courses Registration Corrections With the advent of Banner and UIC Web for Student  students  departments and colleges will be able to confirm students  academic records more efficiently and effectively  Students are able to consult the UIC Web for Student at any point to confirm their schedule and transcript  which should eliminate long term errors by giving students the opportunity to correct problems immediately  especially current registration issues with section numbers  missing courses  and course hours UIC Web for Student Failure to register properly on the part of the student will not be considered  by itself  an acceptable reason to process late and retroactive registration changes  A Graduate College Registration Revision form must be attached to all petitions regarding course changes Transfer Credit Toward An Advanced Degree See Transfer of Credit  Transfer of Credit Petition Deadlines Students are expected to take corrective action immediately upon discovery for registration petitions  Other petitions must be filed not more than    days from the time of the occurrence leading to submission of the petition  or from the time when the student should reasonably have been able to determine that the occurrence leading to the petition might have affected his her status  unless the student was given an earlier deadline  Directors of Graduate Studies likewise  are expected to advise students of the earnestness of deadline concerns in exercising their petition rights as graduate students See also
