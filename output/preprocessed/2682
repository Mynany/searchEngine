Gund  a philanthropist and art collector  who used proceeds from the sale of a multimillion dollar painting to start the fund with the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors Art for Justice Fund A component of this project is to compile stories of families experiencing homelessness and housing instability  Reynolds said  Through audio recordings  people describe the steps they must go through to comply with laws  hold down a job while meeting those requirements  and ultimately find a place to sleep Reynolds and volunteers have been going to Chicago police headquarters at dawn to meet with people who must re register weekly because they lack a fixed address  People often wait for hours to register  arriving as early as four and five hours before the station opens to get a place in line  it is illegal for some of these guys to wait outside the police station  because it is across the street from a school and therefore within a public exclusion zone  adding that failing to register is a felony Reynolds  who joined UIC in       said her project has developed collaboratively with people experiencing homelessness due to housing banishment laws and public conviction registries  which is a damaging role for state government to be playing in the lives of formerly convicted people Illinois has five state registries  which are police websites that publish personal data about people with past convictions  Reynolds said  The rules and reporting requirements have grown increasingly complex  leading to extended registration time and new incarcerations for technical violations  People on registry lists must go to police stations to re register yearly  quarterly or weekly if they are homeless  but no employer will let you take off one day a week to go to the police to re register  Photo by Soohyun Kim Most people with sex offense convictions are subject to housing banishment laws for life  even if they get off the registry  They cannot reside within     feet of a school  playground  child care center  home day care or any location providing programs exclusively to minors  these zones render nearly all housing illegal Even the Illinois Department of Corrections  or IDOC  she added  For the past decade  an average of    and for many that means homelessness Reynolds  a policy advocate  has a long history working on criminal justice issues  focusing on the most extreme policies inside and outside of prison  She was the organizer of Tamms Year Ten  which former Gov  Pat Quinn shuttered in       She was also in the      work group convened by IDOC to address this housing shortage In       Reynolds convened a conference at the UIC Jane Addams Hull House Museum and Northwestern Pritzker School of Law  victim advocates  service providers  faith leaders and elected officials to examine how these laws debilitate families  driving them into housing instability  unemployment and poverty Last year  Reynolds was one of seven international artists invited to present a commissioned work at a summit entitled  advocates  and service providers  along with comedy and dramatic re enactment  before an onstage audience  She also organized  with rape victim advocate Lynne Johnson  a policy symposium titled  followed by dialogue between legislators  state officials and victim advocates The Art for Justice grant will help this growing alliance seek more pragmatic policies  Given that    percent of Illinois adults have some criminal record  these laws impact people at high rates and have disproportionate racial outcomes  she said  For example  one in every     men in Illinois is on the sex offense registry  For African American men  this rate is one in      according to Reynolds Earlier this year  Reynolds was one of only eight people internationally to receive the inaugural Soros Arts Fellowship by the Open Society Foundations and received an         stipend to support this project  Essential to this work is building community partnerships to advocate for policies that prevent victimization  support survivors and allow people to lead positive and productive lives after a conviction Soros Arts Fellowship  n nContact n
