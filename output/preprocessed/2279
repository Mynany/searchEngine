Professors Bring a Lifetime of Experience and a Fresh Approach to New Textbook Home        Two ECE professors have used their vast knowledge and long time experience to provide a unique approach to an introductory course textbook on signal processing  examples of practical applications and computer code are included  this textbook is also useful as a reference book for engineering students in other departments and for practicing engineers The purpose of the series is to publish work of high quality by authors who are experts in their respective areas of electrical and computer engineering  Each volume contains the state of the art coverage of a particular area  with emphasis throughout on practical applications  Sufficient introductory materials will ensure that a graduate and a professional engineer with some basic knowledge can benefit from it Long time faculty members Laxpati and Goncharoff join a long list of ECE professors who have written books  and  much like other authors  the pair know how to best present the material  Apart from their knowledge  Goncharoff is a highly awarded faculty member  He was the first recipient of the UIC COE Harold Simon Award for Excellence in Teaching in       and was awarded the UIC Silver Circle Award for Excellence in Teaching five times  The award is especially meaningful as its selection committee is made up of the graduating seniors  The pair became colleagues when Goncharoff was hired as assistant professor in the same department in      The pair became friends and often discussed how to best teach an introductory signal processing course  which they taught over the years  In       when both were already retired but were still teaching part time at UIC  Professor Laxpati approached Goncharoff with the idea to write and publish a textbook together on the topic of signal processing  Without his hard work and dedication  this project would not have come to a fruitful conclusion  I am very grateful to him for that author  and agreed to the task with the assumption that the writing project would take one year to complete published later that year  Writing the second half took another year  The self published versions were well received by students  so we decided to submit our work to major publishers for world wide marketing and distribution While there are many exceptional books on the topic  they decided to present analog and digital signal processing concepts in parallel to make the difficult material easier for students to understand and to make it possible to cover all the required material  which was well received by the students  we have the discrete and continuous topics covered in alternate chapters retaining the section by section parallel coverage  There are two other features in this book that do not appear in other textbook on this topics  we have a large number of solved homework problems in an appendix  there are numerous Matlab codes throughout the book that allow student readers to implement and experiment  Another aspect of this text book that should be highlighted is that we start from very basic material and lead the reader through some very advanced topics  In addition  we discuss some relationships of transform techniques in signal processing that lead to better understanding of material in ancillary areas World Scientific Publishing Co  published their book  However  and the final product was released in January      year effort took us four years  which included full time work during the summers and part  part  but also in content as we decided to add new material to make the textbook more useful for students Each author has published various journal and conference papers  laboratory manuals  compilations of course notes  and handbooks during their long teaching careers Learn more about Laxpati at Laxpati profile Laxpati profile Goncharoff profile By David Staudacher  UIC By David Staudacher  UIC   Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus
