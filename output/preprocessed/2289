Researchers are Teaching Robots How to Push Back Home        Imagine you are moving a couch with a friend  As you start  you both need to crouch down  securely grab it  and simultaneously lift it up  As you carry it  you may say a word here and there  but that is clearly not enough to coordinate your actions  You mostly communicate through force  you can feel whether to move forward or backward  left or right and it can tell you to raise the couch higher  put it down or to stop moving  of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  and Professor Barbara Di Eugenio  of the Department of Computer Science  CS  understand the importance of clear communication while collaborating  Now  they have teamed up to enable robots to communicate and collaborate with people The goal of the project is to develop a computational and data driven framework for a robot to collaborate with humans in everyday tasks that involve physical interaction  such as handing over or moving an object together  Using models learned from observing humans perform these tasks  the robot will engage in back and forth communication where both spoken words and forces are exchanged  Now we are focusing on force and speech and trying to understand the back and forth exchanges between collaborators in everyday tasks to assists the elderly In natural language processing  NLP  researchers have studied models of dialogue between humans  In these models  it can be determined who the leader is  who has control of the conversation  and who is the follower  Humans know what to do  to become a leader or when to be a follower  when should the robot become a leader instead of a follower  The robot  in a sense  has to be programmed to understand all of these things  moving furniture together  or passing food at the dinner table  When we execute these collaborative tasks  signals at different levels of abstraction are exchanged  speech is at a high level  while force exchanges are at a lower level  The two combine in such a way that for example  We are trying to model that coordination  the only thing that I can sense from your part is the force you are exerting on the object There is still a lot of research to be done when interpreting conversation where people are collaborating on physical tasks  The two researchers see these force exchanges as gestures that need to be incorporated to make sense of the entire interaction  Conversation is just the language part  but the whole interaction includes all these signals and one needs to make sense of all of them so  ultimately  the robot can interact in an appropriate way  And through these forces I can tell you what to do  If we are moving and I stop the object  you will feel it and you will stop  So I have signaled something to you  in language  you may not get the full meaning unless you see what the person is doing  We are trying to formalize the way we can inform the meaning of language from force signals  This is something that has not been studied so far  We also want to use language to understand forces  We are putting all of this in one space where there is no distinction between force signal and speech In order to collaborate with a person  the robot needs to be smart enough to know whether to do something physically  move an object  or say something   and there needs to be a smooth transition between the two  Humans are very good at this  because it requires reasoning about the physical world and all the information you have about it The research was made possible by a three year National Science Foundation grant to the two professors for        Robot Physical Collaboration Zefran Profile Di Eugenio Profile By David Staudacher  UIC   Facebook    Twitter    Google
