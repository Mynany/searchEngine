Students Addressing Global Health Needs Home        Students from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  and their peers from the College of Engineering are taking on challenges to improve health care in the developing world EWH  the students are using their engineering knowledge and skills to help people in Vietnam and beyond When they are not in the classroom  the students are working together to build unique devices at UIC  This past year  the students constructed a prosthetic arm for a    year old girl in Vietnam  who lost her arm in a playground accident  They also developed a hearing test device that can be easily replicated and used in a variety of locations around the world  and one is a prosthetic arm  a junior in ECE  we are focused on getting the basic prototype of the shape of the arm  as I get more of an idea on how the creation of devices are made  I like this project as it will be directly helping someone in need The EWH members created a functioning prototype that they have been testing with the sensor less technology they developed specifically for this project  The arm will be custom fitted for the child  while design requirements will assure the arm is low cost  simple  reliable  and  most importantly  comfortable and aesthetically pleasing While there are a numerous fabricators and vendors working in Vietnam  they are not affordable  Also  prosthetic costs have decreased dramatically over the years  and the lowest cost for a prosthetic arm today would still be more than         The UIC students are taking steps to make the arm for a fraction of the price Apart from a prosthetic arm  the students are developing a hearing testing device for the general market on experience Apart from putting theory into practice  Espejo feels like she is truly being challenged as a member of the student organization  I am offering a lot to the team as an ECE student  In some ways  I feel more pressure to do well  I get more out of it and learn more  we started working on the circuit design  and everyone was looking at me to take the lead  However According to Espejo  ECE faculty members provided her with the knowledge to work on the devices with confidence  She also said she can turn to the faculty for assistance if a problem arises  Apart from putting engineering into action  the EWH students are provided with the opportunity to help the less fortunate  but I realized that I like working with the electrical side of things and building things  I was interested in the projects  EWH  are working on  and I decided I wanted more hands on experience Additional ECE students working on the EWH projects include Ziyuan Wang  Dua Shehahed  Danielle Rodriguez  Faraha Saadat  and Ratnay Pandey  The team is scheduled to complete a fully functioning prototype by the end of the semester  and plan to deliver a further revised version by the end of the fall      semester Learn more about the student organization at
