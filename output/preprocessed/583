million grant from the National Science Foundation to build a state of the art computing platform that will incorporate multiple graphics processing units  as well as enable faculty and students to execute deep learning and visualization codes faster  apply more sophisticated models to large scale problems  gain greater insights  accelerate discovery and open new avenues of research Researchers at UIC on the SENSEI Panama Project   Photo  Lance Long demand computing platform that can rapidly learn to identify anomalies in large data sets and produce visualizations or extract features of interest from images  which will help them hone in on answers to research questions  and even tailor the questions themselves  director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at UIC and principal investigator on the grant The grant will support the development of a next generation composable infrastructure computing system  called COMPaaS DLV for Composable Platform as a Service Instrument for Deep Learning   Visualization  It will be developed and maintained by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory and will be initially made available to UIC College of Engineering faculty  many of whom provided use cases for the grant proposal  explaining how they would use this system for research and research education scale big data that cannot be efficiently executed on existing computing systems in a timely manner  Electronic Visualization Laboratory director of research  associate professor of computer science  and co principal investigator of the grant  meaning it can be configured to quickly move  process and store data with few to no bottlenecks  managed by the UIC Academic Computing and Communications Center  as well as to regional and national clusters  storage  supercomputing and cloud facilities Currently  UIC deep learning researchers use small scale clusters or clouds with graphics processing units  These platforms  while sufficient for moderately sized training jobs  limit the size of data sets and the complexity of neural network codes used as training  and require days and weeks to train sufficiently interesting models  so to speak  creating a temporary  on  graphics processing units  whether the codes need more or less of each type of component to run efficiently  researchers can more quickly analyze big data problems and possibly identify specific subsets of the data they want to focus on or abandon  with each configuring the resources it requires almost instantaneously at any time  assuming they are available  it is more beneficial than traditional clouds and clusters that are rigid  over provisioned and expensive One of the applications that will benefit from COMPaaS DLV is SENSEI Panama  a UIC collaborative project with evolutionary anthropologist Meg Crofoot at the University of California  Davis  Crofoot and UIC computer scientists Tanya Berger Wolf  along with Johnson and Brown  are applying deep learning and visualization to process data from aerial photography  terrain maps  GPS collars  and accelerometers  in order to study how coatis  kinkajous  spider monkeys  and capuchin monkeys on Barro Colorado Island in Panama  forage for food  in the field of computer science  these systems are believed to be the future of computing  analyzing and visualizing Big Data sets Part of the grant will go toward the development of a software system to help users interface with the composable platform  Robert Kenyon and G  Elisabeta Marai at UIC are co principal investigators on the grant  n nContact n nSharon
