misinformation  and myths  Premed students with disabilities Premed students with disabilities often receive misinformation about their competitiveness and candidacy for medical school  Misconceptions about the requirements and associated barriers are often at the core of prevailing myths  there is still progress to be made  To help dispel these myths  we asked Lisa M  Meeks  PhD  disability researcher at University of Michigan Medical School  about the most common misconceptions and what aspiring physicians should know  and if accommodated  their scores will be flagged  identifying them as a student with a disability Fortunately  this is false  The AAMC is committed to providing all individuals with an opportunity to demonstrate their proficiency on the MCAT exam  which includes ensuring access for people with disabilities Like most standardized tests  the MCAT program does require the submission of specific documentation to determine accommodation needs  which is considered through the review process  However  they have a reasonable likelihood of approval  Flagging  is no longer practiced  n This belief contradicts the evidence that nationally  almost  %  of medical students disclose disabilities  While students with disabilities are still underrepresented  the AAMC is sharing stories of current students with both visible and invisible disabilities  a wheelchair user  These stories highlight that students with disabilities can be admitted to and successful in medical school  n Jeff Mahlum Emily Hayward Counter to this myth  reasonable accommodations are regularly administered in the clinical portion of medical school  This also extends to employment  with doctors regularly receiving accommodations in residency and in the workplace  n a webinar Many believe that medical schools water down the curriculum or waive competencies in order to graduate students with disabilities  This is incorrect  Students with disabilities must master the same academic and clinical requirements as their nondisabled peers  While students with disabilities have no more or less ability to handle the intensity of the programs  n Patient safety is paramount when training medical students  Concerns about safety  however  cannot stem from presumptions or beliefs grounded in stereotypes or fear  but rather must stem from an observed action  or lack of action  They must be reasonable  legitimate  and well informed  Safety procedures  and the associated policies and protocols  should be in place for all students  There is no evidence that students with disabilities present an increased risk for patient safety  in fact  students with disabilities are often more conscientious  developing an additional personal system of checks and balances with regard to patient care We hope that clearing up these misconceptions will help broaden and strengthen the pipeline of future physicians  For further reading  Inclusion  and Action in Medical Education Lived
