t Home       n At steel mills  slag is a by product that is generated after steel has been cooked up using iron and other materials in a furnace at high temperatures  For the owners of steel mills  steel slag is just a material that they want to clear out to make space for the fresh slag they would produce  But  steel slag is an asset that has the potential to lower gaseous emissions being released from landfills Based on preliminary testing in his laboratory  he is planning to use the steel slag as a cover layer in landfills to prevent carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere Reddy is working with industry partner Phoenix Services  a contractor that manages the steel slag generated at the steel mills  right now  they have to dump it in a landfill if there are no markets for it  which is like gravel  has a lot of markets  It can be used in roadways as an aggregate  At the same time  he said  which used biochar  Biochar is organic matter that is derived out of burning biomass under low oxygen conditions and it looks similar to charcoal  and mixed with the soil  and crops are grown in it  The farmers get a high yield  because the material has a high water holding capacity and it retains a lot of nutrients in the soil  I did some research and discovered that the material can be used for landfill applications  I used it as a cover material  It creates nice biological conditions to put the bugs to work Landfills generate a lot of methane gas  which is released into the atmosphere  A cover will prevent it from coming out  There are often gas extraction wells  but they are not     percent efficient at capturing everything and there are fugitive emissions released into atmosphere cost  but efficient  cover to mitigate these emissions  We got really good results  However  I was concerned and not totally happy with the outcome of this research The professor was thinking of the best way to contain the carbon dioxide when he realized slag is a material he can use  it can convert carbon dioxide into carbonates  And let it stay in the soil itself as a solid  This will prevent gases from coming out Solving the problem of gas emissions is one of the goals of his research  In the U S  Using these as cover materials will create a passive system that prevents gases from being released  He also sees this as a potential problem solver for large landfills and landfills in developing countries     NSF grant entitled GOALI  Innovative Biochar Slag Soil Cover System for Zero Emissions at Landfills  Quantifying and Optimizing Coupled
