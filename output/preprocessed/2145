for summer  Currently enrolled students register during the early registration period in the previous term  Students who wait to register at late registration will be assessed a late registration fee and may experience limited course availability Registration for Zero Hours Registration for zero hours is only available to students who have completed all course work  examinations  Typical reasons for needing to maintain registration after all course hours for the degree have been taken include visa registration requirements  and the Graduate College requirement for doctoral students to maintain registration from the preliminary examination through the dissertation defense  Students wishing to register for zero hours must submit a Graduate College petition and receive permission from the director of graduate studies and the Graduate College prior to the start of the term  Once permission is received  students may continue to register for zero hours provided they remain in the same program  continue to make satisfactory academic progress  and are within the time frame for degree completion  Students with a fellowship  assistantship  or Graduate College tuition and selected fee waiver must maintain the minimum registration requirements for their award  and will not be eligible for zero hours Doctoral students  only  who will not be on campus may request Option B  where only the zero hour tuition  and none of the fees  is assessed  Students on Option B are not eligible to use university services and are not eligible for university health insurance  Doctoral students who want Option B must state Option B and the term s  up to two semesters at a time  on the petition  and must submit another form if needed in future terms  See Degree Requirements  Doctoral Degrees Degree Requirements Repetition of Courses Students can repeat a course for credit if  Grades Transfer Credit Transfer Credit Consideration is given to the transfer of credit in three categories  Additionally  The director of graduate studies will determine whether the    hours should be granted when the student applies for admission to the program  Technically  this is not transfer credit and does apply to any of the limits listed below To be considered for transfer  graduate work must have been completed in an accredited institution approved by one of the regional accreditation associations or by the agencies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation  and must meet the quality and content of courses offered at UIC For probation and graduation purposes  transfer credit is not computed in the cumulative grade point average or Graduate Degree GPA unless such credit was earned in courses taken at UIC Limits on Transfer Credit The specific number of credit hours accepted for transfer is determined on an individual basis  No transfer is automatic Procedures see below  The petition should show the courses recommended for transfer by the graduate program and the number of semester hours of credit received  Students must attach to the petition an original transcript showing grades if courses were not taken at UIC  and a certification from the registrar or college dean of the applicable institution stating that the courses are graduate level and were not used toward fulfillment of the requirements for a degree if not self evident from the transcript itself  Advanced Standing Credit  The    hours are subtracted from the total hours required for the doctorate from the baccalaureate  The    hours are not counted toward the maximum allowed transfer credit limit or computed in the cumulative GPA or Graduate Degree GPA  A petition is not required as the Graduate College is informed of the request directly from the director of graduate studies  A copy of the transcript showing the earned degree is required Degree Requirements Degree Requirements The following requirements for individual degrees are the minimum standards of the Graduate College  Most graduate programs have requirements that exceed these minimums  Students should consult the detailed graduate program listings in the catalog as well as their director of graduate studies for a full statement of the requirements of their particular degree program Changes in Degree Requirements Program and Graduate College policies and requirements change periodically and may not be immediately reflected in campus publications  The online Graduate Catalog is updated each semester to reflect changes to degree requirements and polices  New degree requirements  however  are not imposed retroactively on continuing graduate students  If degree requirements are changed  students may complete their degree programs under the requirements in effect at the time of their initial enrollment  or readmission  if they discontinued degree status at any time  in the Graduate College  They have the option  however  of electing to be governed by the new requirements if they so desire  provided that all requirements of one catalog are met Students who interrupt their enrollment without prior formal approval lose their status as graduate students  see Leave of Absence  If they want to return to a graduate program  they must apply for readmission  For readmitted students the requirements for the degree are those published in the catalog at the time of readmission  or any subsequent catalog  provided all the requirements of one catalog are met Leave of Absence Degree Program Deadlines Time spent on an approved leave of absence will not count towards the time to

doctoral students  Annual assessments are encouraged  though not required Although programs have options on the content and timing of the assessment  for uniformity and the sake of good practice  the policy requires annual assessment of all doctoral students  In addition  care has been taken to ensure that the policy guards against potential conflicts of interest by requiring that the assessment of doctoral students contains an independent element Programs must conduct annual academic progress reviews for all enrolled doctoral students at least once every academic year  Students who are registered under a doctoral program code are considered doctoral students for the purpose of this policy  All annual assessments should include  The requirements listed above represent minimum actions

Student Tuition The University of Illinois is a land grant institution assisted by funding from state of Illinois tax revenue  As a state  tax assisted institution  the university  with some exceptions  non university agencies  Thus  a person who is an Illinois resident for tax or voting purposes  for example  is not necessarily a state resident for University of Illinois tuition and admission purposes  A person has but one domicile at any time  Mere physical presence in Illinois  regardless of how prolonged  is insufficient to establish state residency without existence of action and intention to make the place a permanent residence and principal home  In order to establish bona fide residence in Illinois under this policy  a person must demonstrate presence and intent to reside permanently in Illinois for reasons other than educational objectives The burden of establishing that a student is domiciled in Illinois for other than educational purposes is upon the person  The regulations  factors  and procedures enumerated in this policy will be considered by the university in determining state residence status State residence status regulations are subject to change from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Trustees  A person holding nonresident status is subject to rules in effect when the petition seeking Illinois residency is filed  Nothing in these rules shall be applied retroactively to reverse in state residence status previously granted under former regulations The following regulations are used to determine the state resident classification of a person for admission and tuition assessment  A s  or legal guardian unless the student is independent and establishes a separate domicile A person who is dependent upon his her parent s  or other person in authority  other than spouse  for financial support shall not be considered independent for the purpose of these regulations  A person claiming independence may be requested to present satisfactory evidence that his her parent s  or legal guardian have not contributed significantly to his her support nor claimed him her as a dependent for federal or state income tax purposes during the period in which the person attempts to establish and or maintain residency  Filing and payment of Illinois income tax is necessary to establish residency B  In order to be classified as a resident for purposes of admission  an independent person shall be domiciled in Illinois and a bona fide resident of the state for at least one calendar year immediately preceding the date of receipt of the application for admission  To be considered a resident for purposes of assessment of tuition  an independent person must be a bona fide resident of the state for at least one calendar year immediately preceding the first scheduled day of classes for the term for which residency is sought C  During the one year period in which a person attempts to establish residency  a person must be financially independent  He she must rely upon gainful employment in Illinois or prove reliance upon resources in Illinois for more than fifty percent of the income sufficient to provide for tuition  fees  and normal living expenses  e g  food  clothing  housing  and transportation Income earned as a result of university enrollment  such as educational loans  graduate assistantships  or student employment  is not considered as evidence of intent to establish residency  During the one year period in which a person attempts to establish Illinois residency  a person must reside in the state primarily for other than educational purposes D  A person who is not a citizen of the United States of America may establish resident status unless the person holds a visa  which precludes an intent to permanently reside in the United States  A list of the visa classifications may be obtained from the Office of Admissions E  Noncitizens may commence establishment of state residence with notification of permanent residency status by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services provided the person meets and complies with all the applicable requirements of these Regulations F  The minor children of persons who  having resided in this state for at least    months immediately prior to such a transfer  are transferred by their employers to some location outside the United States shall be considered as Illinois residents for purposes of the computation and payment of tuition  However  this Section shall apply only when the minor children of such parents enroll in a state supported college or university within five years from the time their parents are transferred to some location outside the United States If the parent s  or legal guardian of a resident person establishes a domicile outside the state of Illinois after the person has been admitted  the person shall continue to be classified as a resident student until degree completion  assuming timely matriculation and providing the person maintains continuous enrollment and maintains a separate residence within the state of Illinois G  It is required that a person who claims Illinois domicile while living in another state or country will provide proof of the continued Illinois domicile  Proof may include  but is not limited to  evidence that the person  or parent or legal guardian as applicable  has not acquired a domicile in another state  has maintained a continuous voting record in Illinois  and has filed regular Illinois resident state income tax returns during absence from the state H  A person whose parents move to Illinois may become a resident at the beginning of the next term following the move An independent person whose parent or parents have established and are maintaining a bona fide residence in Illinois will be regarded as a resident if the independent person lives in Illinois Even though a divorced or separated parent who is not a resident of Illinois provides significant financial support  a person shall be classified as a resident as long as the other parent resides permanently in Illinois I  A nonresident shall be classified as a resident if his her spouse is a resident of Illinois and meets the applicable requirements of these regulations  A noncitizen may establish residency through his her resident spouse  provided the noncitizen complies with Section D of these Regulations J  A person who is actively serving in the armed forces of the United States and who is stationed and or present in the state in connection with that service  may be eligible for a waiver of the nonresident portion of tuition in accordance with Board policy as long as the person remains stationed and or present in Illinois  A resident of Illinois  and the spouse and dependent

and public elementary and secondary schools in Illinois holding an appointment of at least one quarter time shall  if required to pay tuition  be assessed at the resident rate  This privilege also extends to the summer session immediately following the term of the appointment Any nonresident teacher who qualifies for resident tuition as described above shall become subject to nonresident tuition for the entire term if the school appointment is vacated prior to completion of three fourths of the term in question  Resignation or cancellation of the appointment prior to the close of the spring term also cancels the eligibility for the resident tuition privilege in the following summer term Factors in Determining State Residency Bona fide residency must be maintained in the state of Illinois for at least one calendar year immediately preceding the date of receipt of the application for admission  or for tuition purposes  one calendar year immediately preceding the first scheduled day of classes for the term for which resident classification is sought  The following circumstances  although not necessarily conclusive  have probative value in support of a claim for state resident classification The university may request documentation of the evidence  Missing evidence  the lack of evidence  or inconsistent evidence may be used to refute the claim of state residency The executive director of admissions  or a designee  shall determine the initial state residence classification of each person at the time the person enters or re enters the university A person who is not satisfied with the determination of his her state residence classification may request that the responsible official reconsider it  For the purposes of admission  the written request must be received by the Office of Admissions within    calendar days from the date of notification of state residency status  For the purposes of assessment of tuition  the written request must be received by the Office of Admissions by September    for the fall semester  February    for the spring semester  June    for the summer term  or some other date as set by the Office of Admissions The request should include the Petition for Determination of Residency Status  available online and from the Office of Admissions  and all other materials that are applicable to the claim  The request and accompanying documentation will not be returned  and the person is advised to maintain a copy for his her record If the person is still not satisfied with the determination after it has been reconsidered  the person may appeal the decision to the director  Office of University Wide Student Programs  The appeal shall be in writing and shall include reasons for the appeal  The appeal must be received by the executive director of admissions within    calendar days of the notice of the ruling  The appeal will then be referred to the Office of University Wide Student Programs  A person who fails to file such an appeal within    calendar days of the notice of the ruling waives all claims to reconsideration for that academic session  Filing deadlines cannot be extended or waived  and late applications and appeals will not be reviewed  The decision of the Office of University Wide Student Programs shall be final in all cases A person may be reclassified at any time by the university upon the basis of additional or changed information  If the person is classified in error as a state resident  nonresident tuition shall be assessed in the next term  if the person is classified in error as a nonresident  state resident tuition shall be assessed in the term in which the classification occurs  provided the person has filed a written request for a review in accordance with these regulations A person who fails to notify the university of a change of facts or provides false information that might affect classification or reclassification from state resident to nonresident status and or who provides false information or conceals information for the purpose of achieving resident status may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action  as well as other penalties which may be prescribed by law  Further information or clarification may be secured by contacting the Executive Director of Admissions       Student Services Building  MC      University of Illinois at Chicago  Office of
