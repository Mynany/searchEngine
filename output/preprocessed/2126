analysis and design of modern electronic systems  devices  and signals for a broad range of applications such as wireless or network communication  electrical power and control  and multimedia information technology  The curriculum provides a wide background in the fundamental theory of electrical engineering and in the mathematical and scientific tools necessary for an electrical engineer to meet the current and future challenges of a professional career  The field of electrical engineering is currently evolving at a rapid pace since it has a major role in the accelerated growth of the technological world  This requires the modern electrical engineer not only to have a sound basis in the fundamental principles but also to have the capacity to learn and assimilate novel advances as soon as they materialize  These qualities are anticipated in the curriculum  Courses are in diverse areas such as signal processing  power electronics  communications  optical and electromagnetic technologies  control systems  integrated circuits  multimedia networks  and image analysis The curriculum includes both required and elective courses  The required courses are in engineering  mathematics  and physics  they provide a wide backdrop in science and engineering  The elective courses are more specialized and offer a broad range of electrical engineering applications  Each student is assigned a faculty advisor who assists in the selection of the courses In addition to classroom experience  the Electrical Engineering curriculum is planned to provide laboratory experience in electrical and electronic circuits  electromagnetics  communication and signal processing  controls  computers  and digital systems  The project requires the students to undertake a significant group design that enriches their knowledge in practical aspects of engineering principles and methodologies  Most of these projects solve realistic problems and the results are presented in an exposition  The curriculum also requires the students to acquire oral and writing skills in expressing their professional ideas and ethical norms The educational objectives of the Electrical Engineering undergraduate program are for its graduates to  Opportunities are available to participate in the activities of the student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  IEEE  and Eta Kappa Nu  the honor society of electrical and computer engineering  An interest in robotics can be pursued by joining the Engineering Design Team  a College of Engineering student group BS in Computer Engineering Computer Engineering is concerned with the application of electrical engineering and computer science principles to the design of computer systems and digital networks  Through creative utilization of tools and knowledge  a computer engineer designs digital systems that are being employed in virtually all fields of human endeavor  This requires a background in physical sciences  information sciences  electrical engineering  and computer science  Computer engineering requires skills in both the design and development of computer hardware and computer software  Depending on need  the computer engineer may work with electrical engineers  computer scientists  information systems experts  biomedical researchers  and people in almost any other field  The diversity of products that involve the design talents of a computer engineer is unlimited  These range from large to small computers to special purpose computing hardware and software embedded within devices and systems  The applications  for example  are in business to organize  process  and communicate data  communications over mobile and satellite networks  digital sound and picture processing for entertainment  household appliances  automotive systems  manufacturing process control  biomedical instrumentation  machine control  and innumerable other fields  The emphasis in computer engineering is on the design of hardware as well as software tools and systems for the acquisition  processing  storage  and transmission of data and signals by digital means All students are required to obtain a strong mathematical foundation  including discrete mathematics and probability and statistics  Each student acquires a common background in the fundamentals of electrical engineering and computer science  This includes course work in computer languages  data structures and algorithms  software design and development  circuit analysis  signal processing  computer architecture  digital networks  microprocessor based design  digital electronic circuits design  and computer operating systems design  Furthermore  in consultation with an advisor  each student can follow an individualized program by taking courses selected from a departmentally approved list of technical elective courses for computer engineering  In almost all course work  students do design projects while learning to apply basic computer tools  The curriculum also requires the students to acquire oral and writing skills in expressing their professional ideas and ethical norms  As a senior  each student gains further design experience working in a group on a two semester design project involving practical application of engineering principles The educational objectives of the Computer Engineering undergraduate program are for its graduates to  Students are encouraged to participate in the activities of the student chapters of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  IEEE  and the Association for Computing Machinery  ACM  An interest in robotics can be pursued by joining the Engineering Design Team  a College of Engineering student group  Qualified students will be invited to join Eta Kappa Nu  the honor society for electrical and computer engineers BS in Engineering Physics The BS in Engineering Physics is offered by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  College of Engineering  in association with the Department of Physics  College of Liberal Arts and Sciences The Engineering Physics major bridges the gap between science and technology by combining a strong background in physics and mathematics with exposure to the most fundamental areas of engineering  The program is based on the recognition that most engineering disciplines are rooted in the field of physics  and that new and emerging technologies rarely fall neatly within a single engineering discipline but often straddle different fields  The program highlights  for instance  the subtle and deep relations between materials science and civil engineering  between solid state physics and chemical engineering  and between electromagnetics and telecommunication engineering This training is especially well suited to students who wish to pursue careers in research and development in advanced technology and applied science  In particular  students majoring in this program are well qualified to pursue graduate studies in most areas of engineering and applied physics  thus qualifying to teach physics in high school The content of this program strongly emphasizes topics in physics and mathematics  however  this curriculum also gives students great flexibility in the choice of topics for technical electives  Students can customize their curriculum by choosing three technical elective courses from many fields Students interested in the Engineering Physics major should contact the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
