reactions including sadness  anger  and fear as well as excitement  pride  and relief  The UIC Counseling Center staff wants those in our student community who have found recent election results in the U S  unexpectedly difficult  anxiety provoking  or threatening to know that we are here for you  for your healing  and for your resilience  You may find yourself struggling with the personal impact of the election  the tone of the national discussions  or if you are experiencing negative treatment  threats or more subtle forms of oppression because of your race or ethnicity  sexual orientation  gender identity  religious affiliation  country of origin or other aspect of your identity  please consider the Counseling Center as a safe space  You may find yourself within a circle of friends or classmates who do not share the same reactions as you  These interactions may evoke strong emotions and questions and may intensify your reactions  We are available to help you in processing your reactions and feelings  The Counseling Center is also participating in opportunities on campus to provide supportive listening and empathy for our students to come together The Counseling Center offers its services in accord with the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association whose leadership recently provided the following message to its membership  Now is a time to unite   to work for what each of us believes to be good and true  and to provide hope to our diverse communities that we can  in many cases  find common ground  As our social psychology tells us  we must listen not only to those who agree with us but also to those who do not  and we need to work to understand each other more fully  It is a time for all of us to clarify what we stand for  to stay true to our values  and model civility and hope for the future  We must recommit ourselves to promoting health and well being for all our people  most especially during this time of stress and concern  Now is a time for compassion and healing  a time to promote our inherent resilience The UIC Counseling Center is committed to doing so Additional tips and resources that may be
