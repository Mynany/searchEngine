I hold a position as Research Assistant with Prof  Tanya Berger Wolf  My general research interests are parallel algorithms and computer architectures  with special focus on sparse algebra and convex optimization on GPUs  My research aims to design novel GPU based algorithmic techniques to efficiently solve ILP  along with its LP relaxation  QP and SDP  My focus is on large sparse problems arising from a computational biology  an applicative area that uses solutions of algorithmic problems to answer questions about biological systems  In addition  my work has application in a wide range of disciplines  such as combinatorial optimization  operations research  control theory  structural optimization  economics and several other engineering fields  Up to now  I have worked on improving the state of the art in Sparse Matrix Vector multiplication  SpMV  on GPUs  providing a solid foundation for my future research  Despite the fact that adapting sparse computation to GPUs is a challenging task  we can envision a speedup that will allow us to solve convex optimization problems faster than any state of the art solver Tanya Berger Wolf FMC Technology Fellowship I am also contributing to IBEIS  Image Based Ecological Information System  This research project aims to build a large autonomous computational system that starts from image data and progresses all the way to answering ecological and conservation queries  Based on image analysis algorithms  IBEIS can identify individuals from species with distinctive striped  spotted  wrinkled or notched markings  such as elephants  giraffes and zebras  I am focusing on scaling IBEIS and its algorithms to the magnitude of image data available nowadays  with particular interest in using GPUs Briefly about me D candidate in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago  If you want to know more about me Computer Science linkedin Research groups Computational Population Biology Lab Computational Population Biology Lab Image Based Ecological Information System Image Based Ecological Information System Argonne National Laboratory Argonne National Laboratory Contacts Email  mmaggi  uic edu mmaggi  uic edu Phone               Address  University of Illinois at Chicago Engineering Research Facility     W  Taylor St  Room      Chicago  IL             Recent Conferences AsHES     Vector Multiplication on GPUs  M  Maggioni and T  Y  Berger Wolf  International Workshop on Accelerators and Hybrid Exascale Systems        Phoenix  May     to appear GTC      Adaptivity and Compression  a Recipe for Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication on GPUs  M  Maggioni and T  Y  Berger Wolf  NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference        San Jose  March       ICPP      AdELL  An Adaptive Warp Balancing ELL Format for Efficient Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication on GPUs  M  Maggioni and T  Y  Berger Wolf  International Conference on Parallel Processing        Lyon  France  October      pp        ICCS      An Architecture Aware Technique for Optimizing Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication on GPUs  M  Maggioni and T  Y  Berger Wolf  International Conference on Computational Science        Barcelona  Spain  June     pp          HiCOMB      GPU based Steady State Solution of the Chemical Master Equation  M  Maggioni  T  Y  Berger Wolf and J  Liang  International Workshop on High Performance Computational Biology        Boston  May     pp          GTC      Unveiling Cellular Mechanisms using GPU based Sparse Linear Algebra  M  Maggioni  T  Y  Berger Wolf and J  Liang  NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference        San Jose  March       Research In previous semesters I have held a position as Teaching Assistant in the department of Computer Science  I was assigned to different courses Computer Science Teaching  n
