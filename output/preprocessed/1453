Fellowship t t t t Home       n John Klein  a PhD student studying Materials Engineering within the Civil and Materials Engineering Department at UIC  has been selected for a fellowship award in the U S  Army Research Laboratory  USARL  Research Associateship Program Earlier this year  two researchers from The Composites and Hybrid Materials Branch of the USARL visited UIC  and met with CME Associate Professor Eduard Karpov to discuss opportunities for collaboration  The researchers expressed specific interest in some of the research coming out of his lab  They also were looking for U S  citizen PhD students in the field of materials engineering  After receiving positive feedback regarding his credentials  he applied to the fellowship  interviewed via teleconference  received an offer  and started the fellowship in September based modeling  His background in mechanics and materials science along with his computer skills make him a great fit for a large variety of research projects  He is a talented researcher with huge potential to discover  He has demonstrated a great attention to detail  a focused and goal oriented mindset  and he possesses an excellent ability to adapt to new environments and create new ideas As a fellow  Klein receives a monthly stipend of a more than        that will last    months  In addition to the generous monthly stipend  the award includes funding to allow him to travel to the USARL facility in Maryland and to a conference  Apart from learning from others  the traveling provides opportunities to network with researchers and meet personnel who can serve as resources in his efforts moving forward  The award is renewable for a second and third year  The behavior is outside of the realm of normal materials  These unusual properties could be related to how the material interacts with light  sound or forces  For instance  In acoustics  the same principle applies  you can hide objects from sound if you cloak it with an acoustic metamaterial  The sound or light passes through the object as if it is not even there Additionally To address this question  they are developing a new class of mechanical metamaterials that manipulate the internal energy distribution and stress profile in response to surface loads  we demonstrate it is possible to deflect along a path and sometimes block at the surface certain types of loading patterns  applications may include advanced armor systems  which would prevent certain loads from penetrating or structural systems  which when subject to certain load patterns are able to deflect them along a predefined path  The underlying objective of the Weapons   Materials Directorate within the USARL is to enhance the war power capabilities of the soldier  whether that be advanced protection or weapons systems  I like to think I am contributing to the former rather than the latter By David Staudacher  UIC By David Staudacher  UIC  n nFacebook n  n nTwitter n  n nGoogle Plus n  n nLinkedin n
