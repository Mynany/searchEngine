is constantly evolving through its applications in emerging areas  Today  mechanical engineers are not only trained in traditional fields such as fluid mechanics  heat transfer  machine design  and controls  but they also learn how to apply the fundamental principles from engineering  physics  chemistry and mathematics to address complex problems in interdisciplinary areas such as biomedical engineering and nanotechnology  Mechanical engineering also is one of the broadest fields of engineering and its graduates find jobs in various industries such as energy  aerospace  manufacturing  robotics  and medical devices  just to name a few   All Biomedical Engineering Computational Mechanics Data Driven Decision Making Design  Controls and Manufacturing Energy Material Engineering Micro
