Prof  Milos Zefran Researches Robots as a Solution for Caring for Aging Adults Home         Milos Zefran wants to make the world a better place for people  His interest in helping humanity and robotics started in the early   s when he was a student in Slovenia working in a lab where he was part of team helping paraplegics walk by controlling their muscles with an electrical stimulator  So I started working in robotics and have been doing it ever since Today  he is leading a team of Ph D  His team is made up of Ehsan Noohi Bezanjani and Bahareh Abbasi  who are researching physical interaction  Sina Parastegari  who is engaged in handover  and Yao Feng and Andrey Yavolovsky  who are working on safety According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than     million people are living in nursing homes in the United States  However  research shows that people that live at home are healthier  more satisfied  in better shape  and can keep in touch with the family  these people need some help  There is a severe shortage for this workforce  and we want to see if we can use robots to alleviate these problems There are robots that can talk to people and keep them entertained and there are robots that remind people to take medications and attend appointments  However  these robots are not performing any physical tasks in the home  and that is one of the challenges his team is addressing  Providing support for seniors is something Zefran sees as necessity as a rapidly expanding senior population could benefit from new forms of home assistance technology  That is a major determinant  and can be the difference between someone staying home or having to move to the assisted living facility  the robot cannot just replace you  It needs to be a collaborator  not just a servant to the human Helping and collaborating are the key objectives of the robot  Aging adults need to be engaged  thinking about what needs to be done  and moving around  If the robot does everything for them  the people will deteriorate quickly and it will defeat the purpose  moving things together  passing things to each other  and these are the things we are studying Zefran and his team are researching how a robot can smoothly transfer an object to human  The goal is to not let the object fall  and execute a smooth transition without the person having to pull the object from the robot  The robot should understand to let it go  To accomplish this task  the team uses a variety of research tools  and at this stage their main instrument is a data glove  so we can see how you grasp something and how strong the forces are  setting table together  and pass forks and knives Zefran is interested in measuring force exchanges with this glove  and the action and nonverbal communication they convey  All of the participants in the experiments use physical interaction and often communicate through that physical contact without saying a word  we constantly push and pull to try to express where we are with a task  We are trying to understand these actions and figure out whether there is some sort of language in this physical forces that are being exchanged Safety First Apart from physical interaction in collaborative activities  students are researching other aspects of collaboration  safety being the most important  They are using a life size robot to study how it can safely hand over an object  we are always concerned about safety  We can come up with a mathematical expression that formalizes requirements such as that the robot should never exert a force larger than a specified threshold or that it should never hit a human faster than a certain speed In another part of the lab  a miniature autonomous car captures a realistic example of how a real autonomous car works  without the dangers of everything around it and the difficulty to buy and manage a real car  Instead of testing the ideas on a complicated and expensive system  the little car with the sensors and laptop is a much simpler system  think and move  Not all robots need to look like a human The complex robots Zefran and his team are developing will not be available for several years  They must have a full understanding of the fundamental principles behind each robot task before moving to the next level  and then we can build robots that effectively use them  We are not doing that right now but are excited about the opportunities for new developments in the future Milos Zefran By David Staudacher  UIC David Staudacher   Facebook    Twitter    Google
