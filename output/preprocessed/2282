Professor Mazumder Awarded Grants for Power Semiconductor Device Control and Cyber Physical Energy Systems Research Home        In       ECE Professor Sudip K  Mazumder traveled the globe to deliver keynote lectures at the IEEE Southern Power Electronics Conference in Chile and the IEEE Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems Conference in Brazil  He also delivered IEEE PELS distinguished lectures in India  Chile  and the United States  The prolific professor also was the co S gate photoconductive semiconductor switch Mazumder Electronics Systems  was awarded two new research grants The first grant is for research in the power electronics area and the research is titled Control of Next Generation Naval Wide Bandgap Power Electronic Systems using Predictive Switching Sequences and Switching Transitions  a radically new multi scale control for wide bandgap  WBG  power semiconductor device based converter will be pursued and its efficacy validated in real time operation scale control is its ability to achieve performance optimality for the WBG converter at the device level  realized under large signal stability bound  controls the time evolution of the switching states of the WBG Converter  controls the transitional switching dynamics of the WBG power semiconductor device  and co synthesizes the switching sequence based control and switching transition control mechanisms under one unified control framework to achieve multi scale optimality for the WBG Converter encompassing energy conversion efficiency  dv dt and di dt device stress  and electromagnetic noise The funding for this project was made possible by a three year grant of approximately          from the Office of Navy Research Researching Smart Railway Grid Another project he is working on is called the CPS  Breakthrough  Collaborative Research  Transactive Control of Smart Railway Grid  This project goal is to create a smart cyber physical system  CPS  approach for improving the electric rail infrastructure in the United States He is researching electric trains and how they consume energy from the electric grid or railway grid  The trains have a time table or schedule  and the operators know the distance between stations  They can calculate the timing and this is how the railway operators  based on these average calculations  negotiate with the electrical grid how much power will be needed  and they lock in a price  but maintain the same average  The faster you travel  the more energy you need  Slower you travel  the less energy you need  The idea is to have the same average velocity based on which they have done the timetable  but create a velocity profile of the train which will require less energy consumption This is one of the main ideas of his research  When the train is traveling  there will be times when the price of electricity is lower and the train can speed up  because even if you increase the power  the cost will be lower  Alternatively  the train can be slowed down during peak times when the cost of electricity is higher  By doing so  the railway operators are reducing the energy consumption  which would cost them a lot  That means the train is running based on a transaction  In such a way that you can have energy savings and both the parties basically win For this project  Mazumder is collaborating with engineers in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transport Authority  where significant modernization efforts are underway to improve its electric train system  The team also will validate the technologies through a strong international collaboration  and collaborating with a co PI at MIT  The funding for this project was made possible by a two year grant of      Mazumder profile By David Staudacher
