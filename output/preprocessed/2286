ECE Graduate Students Honored with Awards Home        Graduate students work hard on research projects throughout the year  Four students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering saw their efforts result in awards and scholarships  which will help fund their projects Annual Graduate College Outstanding Thesis and Dissertation Award Fausto Annicchiarico Petruzzelli is one of only seven recipients of the      Annual Graduate College Outstanding Thesis and Dissertation Award invasive Cardiovascular Monitoring Petruzzelli was recommended by ECE Department Head Rashid Ansari and Professors Mojtaba Soltanalian and Shane Phillips  He worked under the joint direction of Professors Ansari  Soltanalian  and Phillips do attitude  He is extremely strong in the knowledge of theory  analytical skills  and practical implementation on projects  and at the same time  has an excellent grasp of the instrumental theoretical foundations  which must be clear from his thesis work and hardware implementations  Behavioral and Social Sciences  Engineering  Mathematics  and Physical Sciences  and Life Sciences Chicago Consular Corps Scholarship Ahmed Mohamed has been chosen as a recipient of Chicago Consular Corps Scholarship for the academic year      OIA  He is one of only nine successful applicants university     scholarship  Eligibility for the scholarship is limited to students who have a minimum cumulative UIC GPA of      on a   point scale  Not just for the money but for what it will say about my place at UIC Mohamed is working on his Ph D  under the direction of Richard and Loan Hill   Distinguished Professor Michael Stroscio in the Nanoengineering Research Laboratory  intelligent  and hard working students I have ever encountered teaching at UIC  Duke University  and North Carolina State University over a period of thirty years explanatory  what is far more remarkably outstanding is his desire to acquire as much knowledge as possible regarding different fields of studies  He is not only a promising student  but also a well  rounded individual with broad  dedicated  and altruistic interests Provost   Deiss Award for Graduate Research Marco Poort was one of only    students throughout the university to be named a recipient of the Provost   Deiss Award for Graduate Research  The competitive award provides students with grants of       to       to support their research  which will serve as a proof of concept for future grants that will be vital to my dissertation and also it may lead to a potentially patentable device Poort was recommended for the award by ECE Distinguished Professor Emeritus and Associate Dean Piergiorgio L  E  Uslenghi  He is working on his Ph D  in the Andrew Electromagnetics Laboratory under his direction  He has an impressive knowledge of applied mathematics and electrical engineering  and intends to devote his professional life to an academic career as a university professor specializing in electromagnetics applied to antennas and microwave devices  with the utilization of novel electronic materials and the goal of integrating such devices into systems for communications  remote sensing  and biomedicine C  and May Preble Deiss Fund for Biomedical Research Award  which are collectively called the Provost Deiss Award Chip Hardware Security  And financially  this award will help me in building a hardware setup for testing the proposed idea Kenarangi was recommended by Assistant Professor Inna Partin Vaisband  where he works in the High Performance Circuits and Systems Research Group laboratory under her direction  D  students and engineers who were working under my supervision  I rank Farid at the very top for his ability to conduct independent research and for his productivity Vaisband  independent  and hard working researcher and engineer  His recent theoretical work on detecting hardware attacks in modern ICs comprises proof of concept at the circuit  model  and algorithmic levels and exhibits a promising foundation for producing a new design discipline at the intersection of physical modeling  data analytics  and Internet of Things  The award is a way for students early in their studies to develop new research directions for their Ph D  dissertations or terminal degree thesis capstone project and has been used by graduate programs as a way for students to practice writing research proposals ece uic edu graduate studies https   www ece uic edu graduate studies  UIC David Staudacher  UIC   Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus    Linkedin
