Department Home WELCOME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Illinois at Chicago welcomes you to its web site  We hope that these pages will provide a starting point to the information about the department  faculty  staff and students  We welcome prospective students  friends and colleagues to browse through the information that is provided here and to contact or visit us for more information The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers Bachelor of Science  Master of Science and the Doctor of Philosophy Degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering We are a Department of about    faculty  over     undergraduate and over     graduate students  The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department is very new  having been created in July of      from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department The origins of this department has its roots in the Department of Information Engineering which existed at the start of the University of Illinois at Chicago in      and eventually evolved into the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department in      The current Departmental structure is more focused  and provides an opportunity for the development of research and teaching programs in the areas of Electrical and Computer Engineering  We offer a strong and diverse program with nearly    experienced faculty members  Our broad and multidisciplinary thrusts have proved to be a significant growth opportunity in terms of research and funding success in all our major thrust areas and concentrations  Our successes in research funding  publications and recognitions of our faculty are listed in the following pages and under News Archive We are proud that half of our faculty are Fellows of the IEEE  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  and many are also Fellows of other peer societies  We are also particularly pleased to note that a number of our faculty members have received the prestigious CAREER awards from the National Science Foundation  The different research areas of our faculty are outlined in the following pages as are the research centers that exist in the department Thank you for visiting the UIC ECE website  We hope you will find it interesting and informative  Please contact us if you have questions or comments Sincerely  Rashid Ansari  Rashid Ansari ECE Professor and Department Head What is ECE  Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  is a broad discipline that encompasses a wide range of activities and is at the forefront of modern technology  Electrical and Computer Engineers model  design  fabricate  characterize and analyze devices and systems that can sense information or perform complex computational  communication  control as well as electrical power generation and distribution  A primary goal involves the use ofelectricity and electromagnetism for the generation  transmission  processing  storage  conversion  and control of information and energy  In a parallel theme  the fundamentals of circuits  systems  and algorithms associated with the design of programmable systems are used for computing  communications  control  or signal processing Previous innovations in electrical and computer engineering have had a dramatic impact on the way in which we work and live  the transistor  integrated circuits  computers  radio and television  satellite transmission systems  lasers  fiber optic and wireless transmission systems  robotics and medical electronics  A major challenge for the future is the need for increasingly faster and more sophisticated methods of handling information at lower powers and reduced costs for the advanced communications and information handling systems of the future  Today  the quest for increased speed and decreased energy consumption are driving electrical and computer engineering to novel materials and devices that have nanoscale features  and  systems and networks made with them  accordingly  electrical and computer engineering deals with key elements of nanoscience and nanotechnology  Thus electrical and computer engineers are at cutting OTHER IMPORTANT LINKS Enrollment and Graduation Data Enrollment and Graduation Data       Sciences   Engineering Offices      South Morgan St M C
