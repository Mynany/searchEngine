 Overview Block    Body Systems   Homeostasis      Weeks    Credits  is the first introduction to the patient and healthcare system in the context of routine health maintenance and wellness  During this block  students will begin to learn about the roles and responsibilities of various members of the healthcare team  They will be introduced to the basics of the normal structure and function of the human body  including how to monitor health status using vital signs  general appearance  and laboratory tests  biochemistry  immunology  microbiology  embryology  cell biology  physiology  pharmacology  evidence  This core will provide the building blocks to distinguish abnormal from normal  and to understand the basis for diagnostic testing and pharmacologic interventions  They will also learn the basics of epidemiology and biostatistics to support effective clinical practice and interpretation of the scientific literature Doctoring and Clinical Skills  DoCS  and Medical Colloquia are also included in this block  Students will meet their first patients as a medical student  and practice the basics of communication and gathering history and vital signs during a routine visit Students may feel overwhelmed by the large amount of material that needs to be read  digested  and integrated  There will be discussions on ways of maintaining personal and professional well being  and help for developing strategies for coping with the stresses of life and school  Additionally  there will be an introduction to quality improvement processes that apply to personal and professional activities in order to become a reflective practitioner  All of the concepts introduced here will be revisited and built upon in subsequent block courses Block    Pathogenesis Overview Block    Pathogenesis    Weeks    Credits  is devoted to beginning a lifelong pursuit of understanding the etiology behind disease formation and progression and the current ways to stabilize  mitigate  or even reverse the disease process using Pharmacological and Non pharmacological interventions  Also  complementary aspects of patient care will be highlighted so that students may holistically treat patients  give any palliative care they and their family may need  and be able to sustain a viable and fruitful practice  As an aside  students will also learn ways to support their well being  nurture their identity as a physician and a human  and bond with the community that they serve  beautiful  and complex  In Block I students begin a journey into knowing the human body and how it maintains homeostasis via an integrated network of processes that are tightly regulated and fine tuned to run optimally and efficiently  Additionally  and perhaps more importantly  they start the process of transforming a strong passion for being a doctor to becoming the physician they envision  This journey can be hard  difficult  overwhelming and even mind numbing as students process all the information that is needed to master and command in order to assess  care and treat patients with the compassion and competency they deserve Block    Skin  Muscle   Movement Overview Block    Skin  Muscle   Movement    weeks    credits  begins in January following the winter break  and is the first of five block courses  extending for the calendar year through December of the M  academic year  organized in an organ system approach  This sequence is in part oriented toward the logistics of the approach to the cadaver  e g  starting in this block with skin and muscular systems  The content will include study of skin  muscle and bone anatomy and physiology and include exploration of orthopedic and rheumatologic issues  physical disability  and issues in health care such as pain management and appropriate use of testing and surgical intervention in conditions such as back pain Block    Circulation   Respiration Overview Block    Circulation   Respiration    weeks    credits  begins to explore fundamental physiologic and pharmacologic concepts in homeostasis  and introduces the student to some of the most common and significant health issues such as coronary disease  asthma and chronic lung disease  Many concepts in test utility  epidemiology  health systems  and health equity are also incorporated into this block Block    Digestion   Homeostasis   Overview Block    Digestion   Homeostasis      weeks    credits  along with study of the GI and renal systems  begins to explore hormonal physiology  particularly the exocrine aspects related to GI function and endocrine issues such as diabetes and adrenal function Second Year Block    Brain   Behavior Overview Block    Brain   Behavior     weeks    credits  follows the summer break between the M  and M  academic years  Much of the peripheral nervous system would have been explored during previous blocks  here the emphasis is on the central nervous system  the special senses  and many aspects of normal and abnormal human development  psychology  and psychiatric disorders Block    Regulation   Reproduction Overview Block    Regulation   Reproduction    weeks    credits  is the final organ system oriented block course  and extends to the winter break of the M  academic year First Year and Second Year Doctoring and Clinical Skills Overview Doctoring and Clinical Skills  Longitudinal     credits  The course will combine classroom exercises and discussion in small groups  skills practice with patient instructors and with each other  clinical simulation based exercises for instruction and assessment  in hospital practice of the complete history and physical examination  and office based primary care experience in working with patients Early Longitudinal Immersion  ELITE This longitudinal clinical experience  unique to the Peoria campus  imbeds students into a healthcare team during their first two years of medical school to better prepare them for the rigors of medicine and to increase their exposure to ambulatory care Medical Colloquia Overview Medical Colloquia  Longitudinal    Credits  Given the extraordinary amount of curricular content addressed in the typical pre clinical MD curriculum  and necessary to prepare students for Step   of the USMLE examination  course syllabi are usually limited to addressing these high priority issues and are very tightly scheduled and controlled  Yet issues related to medicine are a vital part of everyday news  and bear some relationship to nearly every other academic discipline at the university  The Medical Colloquia offer a varied menu of lectures  seminars  and brief presentations by faculty  students  and guest speakers from around the world related events in the news  introduce students to the perspectives of other health professions  and provide a venue for topics in the Health  Illness   Society  Health Care Systems  and Professional Development themes that do not fit easily into the schedules of other courses Synthesis Overview Synthesis  Longitudinal    Credits  links the week long intersessions between each block course  together with the longer  summative period of Block    In
