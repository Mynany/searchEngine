strategy and standards for the creation  delivery and maintenance of the Red WordPress multisite theme and functions  This is a living document based on the values of UIC and best practices for the creation and delivery of information on the web that will change as UIC explores new services  systems and strategies Look for more information on generating content within the Red WordPress multisite  A companion UIC Web Content Style Guide can be found here  writing for the web and other best practices for web elements here  n      UIC Web Content Style Guide n     Values of the UIC Web Presence Focus on the user User needs drive all of the content and services that make up the web presence  All web content and services are regularly assessed through user testing and use data  Areas of the web presence that do not meet the standards of our users are retired or improved Inclusion The web presence respects and builds upon the varied skills  backgrounds and experiences of its diverse users through inclusive language and services  The tone of all web content should be friendly and easily understandable to a diverse audience Fairness for all The web presence works to ensure equal access to information by providing services that meet or exceed standards for accessibility and usability Investigative methods The web presence operates on evidence based best practices through both original research with our users and external sources  e g Nielsen Norman group articles Nielsen Norman group articles Creative Ingenuity The web presence employs innovative new services and information practices that improve the online delivery of UIC resources and services to our users Public Feedback The web presence consists of services that engage with users and collaborators in the University  in Chicago and with communities throughout the State  the Midwest region and beyond Securing User Data   GDPR Compliance All sites on the Red Network are GDPR compliant  with a floating cookie notification banner that automatically appears on the bottom of the page Goals of the UIC Web Presence The UIC web presence should provide  Audiences The audiences we serve include  Content Design Principles Web content is not the same as print content  media  interactive elements  structural and navigational elements  and metadata  We design  iteratively test and improve our web content based on best practices and web standards Useful Good content design always starts with user needs  Every piece of content  and every system and service  should exist based on an end user persona and a valid  actionable user need Personas are an archetype for a broad user group  Every piece of content should identify one user persona who represents their primary audience A valid user need does not assume a solution or a tool  First identify the need  then design a solution based on that need  User needs are based on evidence from analytics or user research User needs also must be based on actions or tasks  following this template  As a  persona   I need to  actionable task   so I can  desired outcome  Good example  As an undergraduate student  persona  I need to find my academic program requirements  task  so I can complete my degree in four years  desired outcome Bad example  As an undergraduate student  I need to use the course catalog  tool assumed  so I know what courses you have  not actionable Usable Content should be easy to read and easy to use  following best practices for web writing and formatting  Usable interfaces only work if they contain usable content Language should not exceed an  th grade reading level and should be free of jargon and unclear acronyms  In our diverse campuses  it is especially important to use plain language  as many of our students do not speak English as their first language Every piece of content should clearly and concisely convey what the user needs to do to meet their need Accurate Content that is infrequently maintained will become inaccurate  We regularly review our content to ensure that it is timely and correct Accessible Our services should not exclude any user based on ability  We create web content that meets accessibility standards and considers all user needs Web content should meet Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act  IITAA  standards Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act HTML is more accessible than embedded documents  When documents are absolutely necessary  use an accessible PDF format accessible PDF format When writing content about our services  use inclusive language and consider user needs based on ability  For example  if writing about visiting a classroom location  include relevant information about accessible transit options  accessible parking and elevators Findable Our content and services should be findable  on our website and across the Web  This ensures that information is consistent Example  Approved course descriptions appear in the course catalog  Do not recreate content on individual sites which can become out of sync  link to original source Consistent labels that use plain language will help users find content on our site  in search engines and at times  in our physical spaces Using appropriate formatting and web elements  such as headings and bullets  will help users easily scan content on our site  and search engines will be able identify important pieces of information Governance Design and content strategy cannot succeed without a governance structure that ensures the web presence is meeting goals and standards Governance Principles All UIC faculty  The following departments and committees are responsible for design  content  functionality and usability assessment efforts for the UIC web presence The UIC Office of Digital Communications oversees adherence to brand  accessibility and usability standards

RED ACCC provides and maintains the systems and support for the hosting  user management and integrations with other UIC systems of the RED WordPress multisite The UIC Office of Marketing and Brand Management sets the branding guidelines for the University  All primary web properties must conform to these guidelines  and secondary properties should conform whenever possible The Web Advisory Committee is comprised of representatives from all UIC colleges and vice chancellor offices to inform and recommend enhancements and improvements to the design and function of the RED WordPress multisite based on the needs of site users and content creators Resources Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs gov        http   www usability gov  http   www usability gov         https   www gov
