in Psychiatry and research training in biomedical imaging  both at UCLA  Having co authored more than    articles  Dr  Leow s current research interests focus on developing novel probabilistic reconstruction  tractography  and network analyses techniques for high angular resolution diffusion imaging  HARDI  and their clinical applications  Prior to joining the faculty of the Departments of Psychiatry and Bioengineering at UIC  Dr  Leow was affiliated with the Laboratory of NeuroImaging  LONI  at UCLA  and developed several key high dimensional non linear image registration techniques  Dr  Leow continues to collaborate extensively with Professor Paul Thompson at LONI  Drs  Lori Altshuler and Jamie Feusner at the Department of Psychiatry at UCLA  Prof  Tony Simon at UC Davis  and Prof  Moo Chung at the University of Wisconsin Madison  with joint projects investigating a wide range of neuropsychiatric illnesses including bipolar  late life depression  Alzheimer s disease  body dysmorphic disorder  Fragile X syndrome  and diabetes related neuroimaging abnormalities  Besides research  Dr  Leow enjoys playing classical piano as both an amateur soloist and a chamber musician  Dr  Leow currently performs  as a piano trio  with another physician scientist Dr  Jennifer Goldman  violin  at Rush University and Grammy award winning Chicago Symphony Orchestra cellist  now retired
