International Program Sets the Stage for Student Success Home        Located in the heart of Chicago  UIC offers students a unique educational experience and work opportunities in a world class city  For Alex Iacobucci ECE  set the stage for his professional career as an engineer and provides him with the opportunity to do some acting outside the office Iacobucci  came to ECE through the UIC College of Engineering  At the completion of the program  students get a degree from the Italian university and UIC  They take one semester in Italy and one semester at UIC  where they can extend the time more time is needed to finish the courses and thesis  One was more theory based  and one  UIC  was more practice based with a lot of assignments throughout the semester At UIC  he worked under the direction of ECE Department Head Rashid Ansari in the Multimedia Communications Laboratory  It was the positive experience that help him grow as an engineer  He was always available  yet he gave us a ton of autonomy  which I liked  he made it possible to get a powerful computer that we needed for our operations  and he was always available to meet or respond to emails In the lab  Iacobucci was working on a project that was a partnership with Altera Intel  The team had to prove that by using a specific algorithm that they had to come up with  using their latest FPGA that it was possible to achieve better results in MRI image transformation than with current technology Apart from learning a lot  Alex praised the program for providing him with a different perspective of engineering research S  or you want to face another reality and expand your horizons  It is well known that American universities provide a significant contribution to scientific research  Regardless of what your final life objective is Along with the support he received within the ECE department  Alex also praised Lynn Thomas  the program coordinator for the Master of Engineering and International Programs  She was always super nice and a great resource  She would respond to emails in little time or she would be in her office if you wanted to talk to her in person Apart from the program  Alex loves living in Chicago and everything the city has to offer  Now  he is working as a software engineer at Chicago based HERE Technologies  HERE creates living three dimensional maps that grow upwards  breathing with layers of information and insights  It started with the simple goal to digitize mapping and pioneer in car navigation systems  Over the next three decades  as NAVTEQ and Nokia Since he is still young in his career  he has ambitions of moving up the corporate ladder  You think  Now  At the same time  So you still have to deal with technical stuff  I still want to be rooted in the technical aspect  but I also want to have a higher vision  he can be seen on stage performing in musicals  Illinois Iacobucci is only one of the many ECE students who graduated from this international program and landed at a top company Among the recent graduates are Andrea Manavella graduated in      and landed a position with one of biggest names in Silicon Valley  He is the Camera Design Lead at
