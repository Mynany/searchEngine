the majority of these events do not lead to tumor formation as these abnormal cells are eliminated by defense mechanisms  Instead  tumors arise when a mutation happens in a particular cell type that is uniquely sensitive to it  Identifying such cancer cells of origin is essential to properly target cancer Maxim Frolov and Majd Ariss  Photo  Jenny Fontaine For example  mutations in the retinoblastoma  RB  which normally blocks abnormal cell growth and division  gives rise to retinoblastoma  a type of eye tumor  Retinoblastoma arises in specialized retinal cells called cone cells  which collect light  Why this kind of cancer always starts in cone cells is unknown  But if scientists can get a clearer  more accurate view of the downstream effects of RB mutations in cone cells versus other cells in the retina  they may identify unique therapeutic targets that can prevent or treat retinoblastoma with laser like precision But studying the effects of gene mutations in specific cell types is easier said than done  It is nearly impossible to collect pure samples made up of just one cell type  Instead  scientists often have to use a bulk sample prepared from an entire tissue  some of which may be unwanted no matter how much the sample is purified  professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine A revolutionary new technology called single cell RNA sequencing lets researchers study gene expression in individual cells  eliminating the problem of contaminated cell samples and averaging seq  Drop seq can sequence thousands of individual cells at the same time The single cell RNA sequencer built by Majd Ariss   Photo  Jenny Fontaine Frolov and his graduate student  Majd Ariss  assembled a Drop seq instrument to isolate cells of the eye in developing fruit flies  which the lab uses as a model system  Then they were able to study gene expression changes caused by mutations in the RB gene in thousands of different cells in the eye compared with gene expression in cells with normal copies of the RB gene  Their results are published in Nature Communications published cell RNA sequencing has been performed in cells of the fruit fly eye  we had to create a comprehensive map or cell atlas  accurately describing gene expression in each cell type in the normal eye  We then relied on this atlas to determine how an RB mutation affects gene expression of each cell type in the eye Their analysis of eye cells with an RB mutation revealed a distinctive but small population of cells where the mutation altered gene expression and changed cell metabolism induced cell death  The propensity of cells with mutations in the RB gene to undergo apoptosis is a well known phenomenon and is eventually overcome through additional mutations during the development of cancer  which is characterized by out of  making them resistant to cell death  they were previously missed when whole RB mutant eye tissue was analyzed The Drop seq platform took Ariss more than three months to build  He painstakingly followed instructions contained in a    page manual to generate his first single cell RNA sequencing dataset  Only now can we begin to investigate why and how  For the past year and a half  we performed over a hundred experiments and generated transcriptomes of more than a hundred thousand cells from fruit fly organs  mouse tumors  and human cell lines Meg Critcher and Maria Paula Zappia of the University of Illinois at Chicago  as well as Abul B M M K  Islam of the University of Dhaka  are coauthors on the paper This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants GM      and GM        n nContact n nSharon Parmet n t t t t t t t             nsparmet uic edu
