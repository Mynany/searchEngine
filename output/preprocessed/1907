Web Consortium n t t t W C  as the next generation of the current web  Machine understandable metadata is emerging as a new foundation n t t tfor component based approaches to application development  Within the context of reusable distributed components  n t t tWeb services represent the latest architectural advancement  Such concepts can be synthesized providing powerful n t t tnew mechanisms for quickly modeling  creating and deploying complex applications that readily adapt to real world n t t tneed  n n t t tThe objective of this workshop is to present database and information system research as they relate to the Semantic n t t tWeb and more broadly  to gain insight into the Semantic Web technology as it relates to databases and information n t t tsystems   n nTopics of interest
