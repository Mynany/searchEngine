campus level Diversity Strategic Thinking and Planning Committee  DSTP  The committee met with campus constituencies to gain perspective on campus diversity issues  Each campus activity was assessed to find opportunities to further support diversity  They were assessed in six areas      Environment Climate      Faculty      Research      Staff      Students      Teaching and Learning  Students were also encouraged to participate in the DSTP process through the creation of a Student Advisory Committee  The DSTP was split into two phases   The goal of the first stage  Diversity Strategic Thinking  was to consider how UIC interprets  accomplishes  assesses  and utilizes our diversity  A formal document outlining campus diversity was drafted in early       Current activities and future priorities were shared and discussed in a series of town hall meetings  Communications with students  faculty  and staff provided the foundation for stage two of the process in which a campus and college unit Diversity Strategic Plan were developed  The second stage  Diversity Strategic Planning  mission  goals  and aims were outlined  along with the programs  policies  and activities to guide UIC toward their goals  Each college and administrative unit has a Diversity Strategic Plan that communicates their distinctive agenda  Also included in this phase were approaches and mechanisms for regular assessment of progress and effectiveness About About  n nBack to main content n n n n n n Back to main content Diversity Strategic Plan Awards Leadership Staff Contact Us  n nUIC Logo n n n n
