application pocket to the Graduate College for review  along with written justification for the admission and a copy of the limited admission recommendation letter that was sent to the applicant  The limited admission letter must include the conditions and deadlines for changing from limited to full standing If the Graduate College agrees with the recommendation  the application will be processed in the same manner as a full status admission  If the Graduate College disagrees  the director of graduate studies will be contacted for further review  Exceptional cases should be discussed with one of the deans before the department sends its recommendation for admission to the applicant  and written justification from the DGS must be provided with the file Since Graduate College applicants often apply for admission before receiving their bachelor s degree  they are admitted on pending limited status  application status code     under the condition that they will satisfactorily complete the degree before they begin their graduate studies  Applicants who are admitted under this condition are reminded by the Office of Graduate Admissions  OAR  that they must submit a final transcript noting the confirming of the degree and the deadline There are two categories of limited status admissions  Limited Clear  Status Code    seeking applicants recommended for admission who lack one or more specific admission requirements set by the program and or the Graduate College  e g  has a GPA below            did not take specific undergraduate courses required by the program  etc Applicants may be admitted on limited clear status for a maximum of two semesters  If the applicant s undergraduate grade point average is below      s he is required to receive grades of A or B in the first    hours of graduate level coursework in order to remain in the program Graduate programs may require a higher level of performance and may apply criteria in addition to those stated above  It is the responsibility of the program to notify applicants of and monitor any program imposed admission conditions  When the student satisfies these conditions  the program office must notify the Graduate College in a letter that includes the student s name  university identification number  UIN  and the effective term of change in order to have the student s status changed to full If the student fails to meet his her admission conditions  the program office must notify the Graduate College to initiate drop action  The memo must include the item s  the student failed to comply with from the original limited status admission letter  as well as a copy of the original letter sent to the student at the time of admission  After review  the Graduate College will send a dismissal letter to the student  with a copy to the director of graduate studies  Only in exceptional cases will the Graduate College consider an extension  In those cases  the student must petition the Graduate College and include the department s recommendation  Monitoring limited conditions and dismissing students for not meeting limited conditions must be done consistently and fairly Limited Pending  Status Code    status is the classification for applicants recommended for admission who are lacking official credentials required by OAR  such as official and or final transcripts  examination scores  or proof of baccalaureate  and who also are admitted on limited status by the program  see Limited Status and Limited Clear  The conditions for limited status listed above also apply to this category of limited status In addition  applicants admitted on limited pending status are notified that although they are admitted and can register  the admission will be canceled and the student will be ineligible to register unless the missing credentials are submitted by the beginning of the admission semester  OAR is responsible for monitoring pending admissions and will clear conditions for admission when the appropriate credentials are received  If the student is canceled for violation of pending conditions  this is a separate action than being dropped for violating limited status conditions Nondegree
