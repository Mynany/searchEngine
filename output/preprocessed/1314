Materials Engineering  CME  partnered with a team of scientists from the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago  MWRDGC  a professor from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  and professionals from Ensaras  Inc The national competition  hosted by the Leaders Innovation Forum for Technology  LIFT  a joint effort of the Water Environment Federation and the Water Research Foundation  challenged participants to develop new tools to improve local water and environmental quality through data analytics and artificial intelligence  It featured    teams of students  professionals and technology experts who used innovation and data to help solve difficult real world issues facing water and wastewater utilities Composite Reservoir The team developed solutions to odor issues  which will allow corrective actions could be taken in advance  a soil scientist at the MWRDGC  asked me about joining a team focused on predicting odor events at their large reservoir on the south side  who is working under the direction of CME Associate Professor Sybil Derrible in the Complex and Sustainable Urban Networks  CSUN  Lab  to help with data preparation and Quality Assurance Quality Control  QAQC Complex and Sustainable Urban Networks  CSUN  Lab  reservoir operations monitoring  and sensor data  They had to get each data type into a database format that was usable in machine learning testing  Additionally  they mined the data for time series and spatial trends in order to formulate hypotheses for data that would provide the strongest predictive power  we worked with Dr  Lav Varshney  of UIUC  and Ms  Nina Kshetry  of Ensaras  as they tested random forest algorithms on various subsets of data in search of an algorithm that would successfully predict odor events while avoiding false positive predictions  which will help MWRD improve their odor monitoring program going forward While the contest has ended world solution they were tasked with addressing up this fall to train MWRD staff in implementation of the prediction algorithm using real time data streams uic edu csun uic edu Graduate Studies By David Staudacher By David Staudacher  n
