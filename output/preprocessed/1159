customers for the cost of an UberX ride Uber is launching wheelchair accessible service in the District and five other cities  the company announced this week  pledging a    minute wait time for customers with disabilities for fares equivalent to UberX The ride hail giant has entered into a contract with MV Transportation  to provide the service for customers with disabilities  MV will supply drivers and vehicles  while trips will be arranged through the Uber app Uber has long been criticized for its lack of wheelchair accessible vehicles  and a lawsuit filed by the nonprofit Equal Rights Center in      called out the company for its failure to provide access for passengers in wheelchairs and motorized scooters The app has offered an option called Taxi WAV since       allowing customers to hail a ride in a wheelchair to door UberX  In a blog post announcing the deal with MV  Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company needed to better accommodate customers who use personal mobility devices  and believe that ridesharing can further improve options for riders who use motorized wheelchairs or scooters and want reliable access to wheelchair accessible vehicles Khosrowshahi said Uber would be bringing hundreds of drivers and wheelchair  New York  Boston  Philadelphia  Chicago and Toronto MV Transportation is a contractor for MetroAccess  which provides paratransit service in the Washington region Uber also aims to launch the service in two West Coast cities in       San Francisco and Los Angeles In the Washington region  wheelchair accessible trips hailed through Uber present a new  round the clock option for paratransit customers who have a number of options available  though not all have been reliable in recent years Tayjus Surampudi  a    year old who recently held a Capitol Hill internship in D C  took more than    trips using UberWAV this fall  He said it opened opportunities for him to commute in the rain  go out with friends and otherwise hail a ride at his convenience minute without thinking about it as much as other times  a recent Harvard University graduate  if you want to go out late   Metro  closes early Uber now gives wheelchair users a late night option  he says Still  there are differences between UberWAV and UberX service  Surampudi recalled a time when he was out with friends and said he would hail a ride  The wait time for a wheelchair accessible minivan     minutes  relaying their response Even so  he said  He said wheelchair accessible taxis were few and far between in Boston  for example  where it could take up to an hour to get a ride But there have been growing pains as Uber has rolled out its service In a couple instances  Surampudi said  UberWAV drivers either failed to strap down his motorized wheelchair or did so improperly  And service can be inconsistent  other times where they would respond  but it would sometimes  be     minutes In the District  a city service called Transport DC offers    subsidized trips for medical and employment purposes   The service became so popular last year that the District had to scale it back  MetroAccess offers door to door shared paratransit services for those who live near rail and bus stations  at two times the cost of the equivalent fare from a station or bus stop  a program called Abilities Ride allows paratransit customers to hail accessible taxis for a discounted fare  Now Uber gives them another choice  in most cities  wheelchair accessible vehicles are unreliable and hard to find through existing transportation options  Paratransit options require booking a ride as much as a day in advance  and often mean riders have to wait until many other passengers are picked up and dropped off before they reach their destination accessible vehicles on the road to make the service feasible without a third party dedicated to operating it Malcom Glenn  accessibility and underserved communities C  headquarters this week  He declined to say  however  whether the initiative is tied to the WAV litigation in Washington  Chicago and other cities  The Equal Rights Center did not respond to a request for comment on the subject  because this a population of folks for whom there has been such a huge barrier when it comes to transportation for so long that we can actually work to significantly improve that in a really  really meaningful way Glenn said that the Uber and MV contract is worth tens of millions of dollars in its first year  and that it includes the purchase  modification and maintenance of the vehicles  and the recruitment and hiring of drivers  among other duties  and then they basically put those cars and drivers on our platform Because fares will be subsidized beyond what is typical for Uber  Glenn said the WAV service will operate at a loss  for example  paratransit is the fastest  though the maximum fare is        Paratransit service is mandated for transit agencies under the Americans With Disabilities Act  Glenn said  but we recognize this is a thing where we can demonstrably transform the way that people have historically thought about transportation  a population of people whom there have been huge barriers He said the contract includes performance benchmarks and safety related stipulations to ensure that wait times are met and that drivers are properly screened  and must undergo sensitivity training and a WAV securement certification through a third party before they can be approved to drive on UberWAV Surampudi  who is moving to New York City for his next internship  hopes to make use of UberWAV while there  But he also wants to see improvements  the integration of lower cost options similar to UberPOOL  and the elimination of surge pricing among them  he recognizes  Uber  while cheaper than taxis in his observation  remains significantly more costly than government subsidized transit options such as MetroAccess and TransportDC prohibitive to a lot of people
