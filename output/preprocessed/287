UIC Natural Language Processing Laboratory Home Research People Publications Resources Photos Research in Natural Language Processing  NLP  at UIC focuses on semantics  and discourse and dialogue processing  Our goal is to use NLP to support both education and instruction  and collaboration between human or artificial agents  We focus on three main strands of research  a  NL interfaces for educational technology  b  summarization  including for health applications  c  multimodal communication  including human robot interaction and conversational interfaces for visualization For more details about what we do  please visit the Research tab above Research Here are some exciting things happening in the UIC NLP Lab  Dr  Rachel Harsley  alumna of the NLP Lab  continues her success story by being named one of Crain s Tech    of      After becoming the first black woman to receive a doctorate in computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago in       Harsley joined Google as a coder  Before that  she built a messaging app that won the UIC Startup Challenge  The St  Louis native  whose research focused on natural language processing and machine learning  interned at Intel  GE and AT T before joining Google Read more at http   www chicagobusiness com section tech    page index http   www chicagobusiness com section tech    page index ITF F F  Awards held on March   th at Robert Morris University in Chicago     local college students and ten local high school students are recognized each year for their contributions to technology along with their academic achievements  Mehrdad and David were among a record   UIC CS PhD students who received the award  more at https   www cs uic edu wp content uploads            for future  pdf https   www cs uic edu wp content uploads            for future  pdf Dr  Rachel Harsley  NLP Lab alumna  was awarded the      UIC Distinguished Service Award by the Engineering Alumni Association  The award was bestowed on November           at the UIC College of Engineering Alumni Awards Dinner Prof  Barbara Di Eugenio is co Principal Investigator on a new NSF award that will support the lab work on human robot interaction Robot Physical Collaboration  of ECE  UIC  The grant started on Aug         and will last three years Abstract  This  project will develop a computational and data driven framework for a  robot assistant to collaborate with humans in everyday tasks that  involve physical interaction  such as handing over or moving an object  together  Using models learned from observing humans perform such tasks   the robot will engage in back and forth communication  where turns can  be both spoken utterances and force exchanges  Robots that can  collaborate to perform physical tasks could provide assistance in a  variety of settings  such as performing household chores  supporting the  elderly to remain independent  and assisting human workers on the  factory floor The  transformative idea of the proposal is to generalize the methodology of  dialog processing to include physical interaction  The fundamental  challenge is how to bridge the gap between the symbolic processing of  language and the low level control of force exchanges  The concept of  interaction primitives  IPs  is introduced to model physical  interactions  Further  a planning and execution framework in the form of  an interaction manager is proposed  The proposed interaction manager  broadens the traditional dialogue modeling paradigm so that information  can flow from more abstract to lower levels  and vice versa  language  affects physical interaction  and physical interaction affects what is  said  To build the interaction manager  a targeted data collection where  humans perform tasks of interest will be performed  Since physical  interaction data is invariably sparse  statistical learning on the data  will be complemented by model based generalizations  allowing robots to  collaborate with humans in highly variable and unstructured  environments  The research will inform new course development  and  involve several undergraduate and graduate students   Nick Green successfully defended his PhD thesis  titled  "Example Based Pedagogical Strategies in a Computer Science Intelligent Tutoring System His committee included  Barbara Di Eugenio  advisor  Tom Moher  CS  UIC  Ugo Buy  CS  UIC  Davide Fossati  CS  Emory University  Patrick Seeling  CS  Central Michigan University  n t t tRachel Harsley defends her PhD  March          n t t tSabita Acharya Receives "Fifty for the Future" Award from the Illinois Technology Foundation  n t t tRachel Harsley is honored by NSBE with a Golden Torch award   wins an ACM W fellowship  n t t tNLP Lab Receives the Best Paper Award at ICEduTech         Next End
