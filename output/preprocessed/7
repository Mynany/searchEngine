an extremely rich and diverse discipline   At one end of the spectrum  computer science may be viewed as the formal study of what can be computed and what resources are required for computation   At the other end of the spectrum  computer science may be seen as the application of human resources  software and of course  computers to solve computational problems relating to society s and individuals  needs A well trained computer scientist requires a knowledge of both ends of this spectrum and several points in between   The Computer Science curriculum in the Department of Computer Science is intended to provide that broad background   Along with a strong theoretical component  our program places special emphasis on the development of applied skills in design  implementation and validation of computer systems   In our experience  industry and graduate programs alike value above all people who can solve real problems  and who come prepared to use the tools of their trade All students acquire a common background in the fundamental areas of computer science  computer systems  organization and architecture  algorithms and data structures  principles of software design  elements of the theory of computation  and operating systems   In addition  students obtain specialized backgrounds through the selection of five technical elective courses in Computer Science   Required and elective courses in the sciences and mathematics  along with additional courses in writing  humanities  social sciences and the arts give students the opportunity to expand their horizons and to prepare for multi disciplinary careers There are very few areas in modern society untouched by Computer Science   Computer science is present in everything from health care  telecommunications and entertainment  to transportation  education and defense  The result of this diversity is that a computer scientist must be capable of working with people outside his or her field   In support of this  the Computer Science program provides its students with a well rounded education requiring significant course work outside the Department of Computer Science  placing a strong emphasis on writing and communication skills Getting Started Student Affairs Calendar Student Affairs Calendar Undergraduate Admissions  Undergraduate Admissions  Student Graduation Objectives Student Graduation Objectives Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked Questions Concentration Areas The Computer Systems Concentration represents a sub specialty that provides more emphasis on understanding and designing computer hardware   The student continues to learn the fundamental areas of computer science  programming  data structures  discrete math  algorithms  formal languages  architecture and operating systems   Unlike traditional computer science  however  the student also studies low level circuit analysis and high level system design  and has the option to take additional hardware oriented courses   The result is a unique blend of computer science and computer engineering The Software Engineering Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in software engineering   The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science  including programming  data structures  discrete mathematics  algorithms  formal languages  computer architecture  and operating systems   In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of software engineering practice such as software cost estimation  large scale software development  and risk management The Human Centered Computing Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in areas such as  user interface design and development for desktop or mobile devices  computer graphics and animation for video games  movie special effects  and scientific  engineering  and medical visualization   The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science including programming  data structures  discrete mathematics  algorithms  formal languages  computer architecture  and operating systems  In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of human centered computing practice such as user interface design  computer graphics  visual media  and natural language processing
