can make life easier for people with disabilities  They can also make it harder A group gathers on a Nashville street corner  some rolling in wheelchairs and others walking  They have arrived holding their smartphones and make friendly chatter while a coordinator helps them log in to an app  Dispersing in small groups  they examine restaurants  cafes  and shops  looking for features signaling that disability is welcome there  a parking sign with the International Symbol of Access  a wheelchair ramp  an automatic front door  a wide bathroom stall with grab bars  braille text  low flicker lighting  glare free floors  scent free soap  The groups use the app to document and rate these features  Once submitted  the information accumulates in a database that others can use to find accessible locations a thon  and turn data collection and visualization into tools for disability activism  They take advantage of smart city technologies  particularly geolocated databases of business listings  to share information that may otherwise be available through only word of mouth  But even as they make some things better  digital accessibility maps are only as good as the data they contain  Bad ones risk making urban life harder  rather than easier  for disabled people Digital accessibility maps are proliferating rapidly  thanks in part to the release of apps such as AXS Map  Access Earth  AccessNow  and Wheelmap  In the decade that I have been studying accessibility  I have come across dozens of these projects  and even started one of my own  Some  such as AccessNow and AXS Map  are carried out by and with their potential users  people who are disabled and who identify a gap in more mainstream mapping technologies  Others are supported by people with relationships to disability  such as family members or therapists  and still others by philanthropic start ups and major technology companies  such as Google Digital accessibility maps assume that crowdsourcing serves two purposes  First  user contributed data can provide information quickly while simultaneously educating the public about accessibility best practices  Some apps even allow users to establish profiles and receive recognition on leaderboards for the number of places they have surveyed  Some hope that this will spur the emergence of a new type of urban citizenship  the so called smart citizen  a technologically enabled community member who contributes time  labor  and device time to generate data about everyday life  Even if such a citizen does not identify as disabled  noticing and documenting the built environment can promote awareness of barriers that many people with physical  sensory  and mental disabilities face  nMore in this series Technology is transforming city life  for better and worse People have been crowdsourcing accessibility data far longer than apps have been around  Disability activists have been drawing maps by hand for decades to prove the need for curb cuts  wheelchair ramps  signage  and other features that make public access possible  particularly for wheelchair users  In cities such as Berkeley  California  and Urbana and Champaign  Illinois  environmental audits  mapmaking  ad hoc design practices chair users to get around otherwise inaccessible cities by  for example  fashioning curb cuts from found materials But long before crowdsourcing became a term for technology assisted outsourcing  disability activists were questioning the wisdom of the crowds in this process  Consequently  many of these interventions have taken place outside formal architecture or urban planning practices  That cuts both ways  In Berkeley  people who are blind or visually impaired sometimes objected to guerrilla urbanist curb cuts  arguing that such interventions made cities less predictable and therefore harder to navigate  Eventually  activists worked in cross disability coalitions to produce a new design standard  a curb cut with raised  yellow  tactile bumps that would enable wheelchair access while also signaling the coming change in grade to someone using a cane Like guerrilla urbanism  accessibility mapping is often a collective  political endeavor  a way of staking a claim for better access to public spaces as a group effort  That may sound obvious  but the enforcement of laws such as the Americans With Disabilities Act is often conducted to resolve individual grievances  not to create infrastructure for all  If I encounter an inaccessible place  it is up to me to bring forward a complaint  which may launch an investigation  at the conclusion of which one business may be required to make changes to its physical environment  If I want to make the building next door more accessible  I have to go through the same process  nThe result is a patchwork of accessible and inaccessible locations  New urban trends promoting more stairs and LED lighting  which can cause migraines and sensory overstimulation  and smart city campaigns designed without considering visual impairments  create additional obstacles  Accessibility mapping becomes an ongoing project  not a onetime effort One solution is accessibility map a thons  which have taken place around the world  from Nashville to Paris  Getting lots of people together can produce broad  collective understandings of access and can help people who do not typically experience access barriers to notice and report them  Assembling that data into databases surfaced by apps makes that information enduring  nBut despite their good intentions  map a thons sometimes presume a binary kind of accessibility  Many simply ask whether a location is accessible  yes or no  Others look for wheelchair access alone  ignoring nonmobility disabilities related to sight  hearing  cognition  chronic illness  learning  or chemical sensitivity  In most cases  when the minimum requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines require far more detailed measures of accessibility  nPeople who primarily move by walking might not be aware of the spatial parameters needed for a wheelchair to turn inside a small space  like a bathroom  People who rely on vision to navigate might not know how to assess a location for its friendliness to the visually impaired  People who are not sensitive to certain lighting or scents might not even notice the presence of these features  Crowdsourcing can create as many problems as it solves  But the height of hand dryers and sinks might make it inaccessible  even for the wheelchair users who initially inspired the observation  The quality of lighting or the presence of chemical cleaners could make that same space inaccessible for different people  too  Likewise  information about whether staff are fluent in American Sign Language  whether menus and signs appear in braille  or whether flickering lights could cause seizures often goes overlooked in the data sourced for digital accessibility apps rights motto  Many digital accessibility apps reinforce current trends in inaccessible smart city technologies  According to Smart Cities for All  a project of the accessible technology experts Victor Pineda and James Thurston  smart But    percent of experts report that people with disabilities are left behind by these new urban technologies  Some cities  including New York and Dallas  such as headphone jacks and audio descriptions for people who are hard of hearing and high contrast modes for people with visual disabilities  But most smartphone accessibility apps do not include these features  Instead  their data are primarily visual and textual  creating potential barriers for users who are visually impaired or have sensory processing disabilities  nFor digital accessibility maps to work  they need to be designed by cross disability coalitions  similar to the ones that developed the tactile pavement curb cut  Rather than relying entirely on visual representations of data  for example  digital  Such a map would be able to show images of the doorway or integrate turn by turn navigation  Deeper digital accessibility maps can offer both audio and visual descriptions of spatial coordinates  real time information about maintenance or temporary barriers  street views  and even video recordings  These capabilities are not yet present in most digital accessibility apps  partly because they build upon digital mapping tools that assume that a view of streets and storefronts is sufficient  slowly  In       Google Maps started to allow users to add information about wheelchair access to business listings in six major cities  Once expanded  the availability of such data could supplant other digital accessibility maps entirely  absorbing listings into a global technology in much the same way that other disability supportive technologies have been marketed toward mainstream consumers  This development could result in a more usable repository of accessibility information  eliminating redundancy across mapping platforms  But of course  it also risks institutionalizing the preconception that access means wheelchair access  baking it into a popular  global tool such as Google Maps Global technologies raise other concerns  There are cultural and geographic differences among accessibility standards  U S  guidelines  while adopted or modeled in some countries  do not address the realities of disability in others  A study of toilet accessibility in India  for example  found that standards for wheelchair accessible restrooms are not helpful in contexts where a person crawls or uses a different kind of mobility device  such as a skateboard or a cart  or where squatting toilets are more prevalent  The global popularity of Google Maps  combined with default English language data  may give the impression that accessibility belongs to people with disabilities in Western  English speaking countries alone But even if all these problems were solved  digital accessibility apps still pose one final threat to disability advocacy in urban environments  Apps can make cities more navigable  but they do not change the material features of that environment  Most of the time  they record the current conditions in the built environment rather than advocate for better ones  Before apps came on the scene  disability activists used mapping to catalog injustices and to imagine alternative futures  new environments in which accessibility was the norm  rather than the exception  Contemporary projects should incorporate that lesson  too  By incorporating knowledge from broad groups of people with disabilities  digital mapping could do more than just record the world as it is today  It could also drive political  design  and policy improvements  After all  to deserve the name  a smart city ought to be a better city  not just a more technological one  nWe want to hear what you think about this
