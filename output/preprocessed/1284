Research in Computational Mechanics covers a broad spectrum of topics including  Coupled physics problems  i e  thermal fluid mechanical systems such as earthquake faults  Evolving discontinuity methods for capturing fracture  shear banding  and other forms of localized deformation  Faulting and earthquake engineering  including soil structure interaction  Geo mechanical issues in energy production  including hydrocarbon reservoirs  carbon sequestration  and heat pumps  Computational plasticity  damage and constitutive modeling  Finite elements and other computational techniques   Construction Engineering and Management Construction Engineering and Management graduate studies and research at the Civil and Materials Engineering Department mainly focus on best practices in Integrated Construction Project Management  IPM  with regards to the optimization methodologies for the construction projects given the multitude of constraints including the project budget  schedule  risk  quality requirements  human resources  communication channels  procurement practices and the stakeholder management  In concert with these initiatives  we look into the existing or potential interdisciplinary connections that exist between the construction engineering and across the other economic  social and societal sectors that are often overlooked at traditional project management research and resource optimization practices  These competencies include  but not limited to  engineering entrepreneurship  construction budgeting and financial planning  organizational behavior  managerial strategic planning  game theory applications in construction management  cultural and intercultural considerations in managing multinational and multi background engineering project teams  litigations and construction claims as well as the health and safety  and sustainability initiatives in construction engineering and project management Environmental  solvent extraction   Geotechnical   Geoenvironmental Faculty members study the mechanics of earthen structures  earthquake faults  soil structure interactions and waste containment systems  Research in Geo environmental engineering has a specific emphasis in polluted site assessment and remediation  sediments  groundwater  brown fields  electro kinetic remediation  chemical oxidation reduction  and related issues   Materials Materials engineering research in CME encompasses multidisciplinary subjects in nano sensors  corrosion detection  advanced ceramics and development of sustainable energy efficient systems  Examples of funded projects include  Early detection of corrosion in steel cables  Lead induced stress corrosion cracking of pressure water nuclear power plants  Nano materials  surfaces and interfaces  Energy harvesting and conversion at the nanometer scale   Structural In the area of Structural Engineering  the department is involved in cutting edge research in all areas of analysis and design  including reinforced and pre stressed concrete  and concrete materials research  With major contracts from Shell Oil  the fracture mechanics and durability laboratory conducts research in developing efficient approaches for fracturing and drilling of rocks  In addition  CME researchers conduct pioneering research in fiber optic sensors  acoustic emission sensors  structural health monitoring  and nondestructive testing  Under a grant from NIST  CME faculty members are involved in developing the next generation of wireless acoustic emission sensors for monitoring of bridges  In addition they are using these technologies to develop algorithms for real time damage detection of the eye bars in Bay Bridge  CME faculty members have also received a multi   Sustainable Infrastructure CME faculty conduct research on the sustainability of transportation  water and other infrastructure networks  CME faculty also perform research in sustainable application of remedial engineering design solutions   Transportation CME faculty members conduct innovative research in Transportation planning and modeling  including  Travel behavior analysis  Activity based travel demand modeling  Micro simulation modeling methods of urban activities  Integrated land use and transportation models  Intelligent transportation systems  Sustainable transportation systems  Public transit planning and operations and Goods movement analysis UTC  to provide solutions for urban transportation problems   Urban Transportation Research Center  UTC Water Resources Research in Water Resources engineering is funded by various agencies including the US Environmental Protection Agency  the US Geological Survey and various state and industrial sources    r n     Engineering Research Facility  r n    W  Taylor Street
