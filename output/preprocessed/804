sense A Very Brief History of the AACC AACC  was a couple of decades in the making  Efforts to establish such a space began alongside conversations that culminated in the creation of the Black Studies Program  now the Department of African American Studies  at UIC  then known as the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle  in the early     s  who became the first Director for the Black Studies Program in      and remained so until       According to Dr  Lori Baptista  former AACC Director African American Cultural Center Department of African American Studies Professor Grace Sims Holt Twenty years would pass before the AACC was actually funded and established in       Bolstered by racially and gender based incidents in the early     s  a coalition of campus and community partners  allies  political leadership  and students demanded funding for the center  Following a series of interim directors  Dr  Phillip Royster  Professor of African American Studies and English at UIC  was appointed as permanent Director  In       the AACC was moved to its current location in Addams Hall  Dr  Royster served as Director for over twenty years  creating and sustaining the Visiting Artists Series  a monthly installation highlighting the work of local African American artists  throughout his time at the AACC Visiting Artists Series Dr  Lori Baptista Joins UIC Following Dr  the AACC welcomed Dr  Lori Baptista as its new Director in       Dr  Baptista  who holds a PhD in Performance Studies from Northwestern University  brought with her extensive experience researching and developing arts based and critically engaging cultural programming  as well as working with communities and organizations throughout the Chicagoland area  Prior to joining UIC  and along with Dr  Rosa Cabrera  Dr  Baptista was part of an urban ethnography team at The Field Museum  and worked on a series of grant funded projects focused on cultural diversity and environmental sustainability in various Chicago neighborhoods based approach in thinking about communities and identity  Baptista recounts  that benefit both themselves and the environment  how do you not just come in and prescribe to them what they need to do  How do you really respect the fact that cultural communities  themselves very diverse  have values and beliefs and practices and things that are important to them  How do you harness that first Charged with breathing new life into the AACC and working to further integrate it into other vital university functions  Dr  and all the work that followed  was guided by this assets based approach to community building and sustainability  which was appealing to me because in there is an opportunity to influence curricula  to partner very directly with faculty and academic units  as well as partnering with student affairs units   and  also to bring in research based  data driven frameworks to help support cultural approaches  I was excited about what I could do to bring an assets based approach to the cultural center to try to reinvigorate it  And that was really the charge at the time that I was hired  To help the center become more relevant  to become more deeply connected in very structured  but also very practical ways to academic units  and then to build relationships where it made sense both in the campus community and outside of campus  so first things first  Dr  recarpeting  and bringing the space into the   st century  we put in a TV  we got a lot of stuff from surplus  we repurposed a lot of things  but the whole idea  was  how do you engage more people to use the space   The  visiting artists series was kind of  it was up and there were announcements made about it  and maybe people passed through  so part of the idea for the renovation was to think about how all these spaces would be used  and who would be using them  and how I would bring in partners to do that  particularly the struggles and events that led to its founding  which had not been properly recorded when Dr  Baptista joined as Director  Dr  Royster was particularly helpful in this regard  Baptista recalls  Dr  working to build relationships with partners both within and outside UIC  if we shared this common genealogy with African American Studies  I met with the heads of various academic and other units to understand what they already did  what they knew about the center  how they worked with the center in the past  and to see what opportunities there might be to work together in the future Reinvigorating AACC Programs and Initiatives  Expanding Engagement and Reach From the beginning  under the leadership of Dr  Royster based  practice based arm   a hub that would  support students in a number of different ways that were tied more closely to the curriculum as opposed to just social activities  Baptista  The numerous programs and initiatives developed during Dr based frameworks and research based programming Aside from the Visiting Artists Series  which was meant to provide a platform for young  aspiring Black artists  and to highlight Black culture and tie it into campus conversations  the AACC was mostly being used as a meeting space  Programming budgets had not been increased  Baptista explains  While funding has remained hard to come by  Dr  Baptista figured out ways to develop partnerships and bring in internal and external grants to fund a number of AACC and collaborative initiatives  For instance  in recent years the AACC has received support from the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement  IPCE  at CUPPA  and the Illinois Humanities Council Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement Illinois Humanities Council  Baptista  Our mission is really engaged around supporting the academic and diversity missions through very thoughtfully conceived and measured initiatives that relate the Black experience to a number of different points  that you just do programs  well  we do historical exhibits  you actually have to research them  Even if you were just doing genre based exhibits  impressionist painters  you would still need to research it In       the AACC launched its Summer Arts Festival  which aimed to increase visibility and strengthen campus and community partnerships  Through a series of arts and research focused workshops Summer Arts Festival  I should say  before we started doing things  part of my listening tour  because I come from an assets based approach  we did asset mapping  We needed to understand who were the stakeholders in the center  what were the concerns that people had  what were the visions or the ideas that people had for the center in terms of what they thought it was or what it should be  who it should serve or how it should serve  them  A  Program  Dr  Baptista was invited as affiliate faculty  and this new partnership allowed for participation by Museum and Exhibition Studies graduate students in the curatorial process for programs at AACC Museum and Exhibition Studies M A  Program  within the institution  to build a relationship with an academic unit where the assets that we had  which were gallery space and the ability to create exhibitions  were a value to them  So students would have practical experience doing that  either through  Graduate Assistantships  or student  coursework  to build content material  Two of the Fall exhibits that are coming up now are coming out of the seminar that I just taught this spring for Exhibition Practices The Cavalcade of the American Negro based  critically engaging programming has produced a number of well received exhibitions        or lack thereof  Baptista  its relevance  History  Sociology  African American Studies  all over campus  that tied it in as a co curricular activity  which was also part of the goal and so that was fantastic  was a collaboration with Project NIA  an organization emphasizing participatory community justice  as well as the College of Architecture and the Arts at UIC  A timely exhibition  it explored the relationship between the conditions of slavery and mass incarceration exhibitions The Reason Why Black Inside Project NIA I think  these exhibitions were  successful not only because so many people came  but  also  because they were very relevant and timely   They also  did what we do well  which is use research driven approaches to look at historical events  or social events  issues  or concerns and engage people around those areas in ways that also involve aesthetics In       the AACC collaborated with a number of community based veteran service organizations  the Office of the Dean of Students Student Veteran Affairs  and the UIC ROTC  and of African Americans and people of color in the military  more specifically  while highlighting the complex intersections of race  class  and gender in this context The Things We Carried Thank you for your service  and hosted a series of dialogues around those issues  which were really productive and engaging with that particular community  What we were also hearing  as the Student Veterans unit was being established  is that as more students who were veterans were returning from the war in Iraq and were accessing their benefits and enrolling in classes  they were being asked really inappropriate questions in class by peers  or they were dealing with stereotypes  about African American and Latino participation in the Military   It has to make sense and be of value  and address issues that are already important to people  or be of use to other units  Baptista  This emphasis on collaboration remains a cornerstone for the AACC  and for the six other Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change  CCUSCs  that are currently part of the Office of Diversity  whose Directors meet once a month to discuss potential collaborative projects and thematic foci  Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change For the AACC  a particularly significant collaborative initiative has been to develop exhibitions and other co curricular materials that could be tied to the Illinois Fine Arts and Social Science curricula for K    We had a lot of high school groups  and grammar school groups actually  that would come to our campus and they wanted to visit the AACC  So  for example  to meet the curricular standards  If a teacher were to bring a group of  th graders  we could take them through an activity that maps to the Illinois standards  so they are getting something out of this than just understanding that this is a space that Black students fought for Beyond expanding the reach and relationships of the AACC  under Dr  and in collaboration with campus and community partners  the AACC has also worked to broaden perspectives regarding Blackness  and to integrate the diverse  and yet interconnected  experiences of Black Diaspora cultures  African Americans from Chicago and elsewhere in the United States  African African Americans  Afro Caribbean  Afro Latinx cultures  to enumerate just a few   our audiences can see that  actually Black people are also Hispanic  you know  Black people exist in other planes  and actually there are points of connection that people might not realize they have until they see it and recognize it Cintio Vitier Valuing the work of the CCUSCs  Dr  Baptista shared some of her hopes for the future of the AACC and the various centers at UIC I think  Associate Chancellor and Vice Provost for Diversity  Dr based approach  Baptista points out above  It is also based on her own work  outside of here  I looked at food and identity  and how people communicate aspects of who they are and how they see themselves in the world through food  and never as clean and straight as people might imagine Drawing from fieldwork and visual documentation of the relationship between food and identity in a Portuguese ethnic enclave in Newark  NJ  Dr  the exhibition explores stories of global mobility  race and identity  and community struggle and survival  It aims to challenge notions of belonging  difference  place  and place making  If you missed it b  Yves Francis Lubin  and introduce visitors to news way of thinking about Afro AACC Sanctified In addition to numerous initiatives and exhibitions  the AACC also rents out its space to student organizations and hosts Open Study Hours during the academic year  Some professors have been known to use their library space for Office Hours  which  according to Dr  Baptista  can be a great way to reach those students who may not otherwise engage outside the classroom student organizations Open Study Hours  you will learn something about Black history  Black culture  cultural practices  and traditions  It has to have value to more than just the people who self identify in that way  exhibitions  and initiatives  please visit their website  n      African American Cultural Center n      n nUIC Logo n n n n UIC Logo  n          Office of the Vice Provost
