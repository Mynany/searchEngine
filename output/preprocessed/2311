Q Home        ECE is a growing department with several new faculty members  In the first part of this series we are introducing Visiting Lecturer Paolo Vinella How did you become interested in engineering  My interest in engineering was born since I was a kid  their basic working principles  Then  I chose to attend a technical high school that offered a teaching philosophy very close to engineering  that confirmed my interest in the area What experiences led you to your present position  After graduating from UIC and Politecnico di Torino  Italy  and getting a joint Master Degree in Electrical Engineering  I received a job offer by the ECE Dept  as Visiting Lecturer Can you tell me about your work as a lecturer in ECE  Describe a typical work day Some might think teaching means coming to the classroom  talking and using the white  Not so true  Every class implies deep preparation  a rigor in understanding while finding a way to teach that aims to simplify hard stuff and make it fun to learn  This is something that must meet students expectations and interests and match the teaching quality that has to be a prerequisite for any department  like ours  that does and wants to shine Have you received any awards and recognitions  If so  what are your secrets that lead you to recieving the awards  I believe that becoming a Lecturer and Faculty Member of an U S  university at    years old is itself something to be happy and proud of  A reward for my fullest dedication in my studies while never sacrificing my personal life for it What are your favorite hardware and software tools  I enjoy digital electronics design  preferring VHDL as hardware description language and FPGAs  but also Spice  Matlab and C are among my favorite What are you currently working on  I am teaching ECE      Computer Organization II  and ECE      CAD Based Digital Design  while bringing ECE     close to the world of FPGAs and programmable hardware  In fact  I am also helping the department build up a FPGA Laboratory for the students  with some real hardware platforms to play around  Last but not least  I am starting to work on a challenging project that wants to enhance computation of Non Uniform Fast Fourier Transform using FPGAs and OpenCL Do you have an area of engineering that you specialize in  Digital Electronics What do you do during your free time   but in general it is worth mentioning  trying a different Italian restaurant downtown on weekends  an impulse driven by my Italian DNA I guess  fighting laziness with some physical activity  swimming and working out  running to the movie theater as soon as a new movie comes out with endless popcorn and soda refills  going out with my friends and girlfriend  planning my next vacation  and experimenting with cooking at home  Of course when temperatures go down  Spotify and Netflix become my best friends What direction do you see yourself in a few years from now  Or what would you like to accomplish at UIC  As an engineer  I like to plan things in advance  But as human being  sometimes surprises arrive to alter my plans  In my future I would like to be partly involved with teaching or research activities at UIC while cooperating more with the Industry  I would go for managing a nightlife PR Company in Shanghai Learn more about the visiting lecturer at Paolo Vinella Paolo Vinella   Facebook
