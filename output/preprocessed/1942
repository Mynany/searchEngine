inference  graph mining  network science  and privacy  My research goal is to unify these aspects in a single framework that allows us to reason better with data and solve important societal problems  I am especially interested in algorithms for heterogeneous graphs and networks  with focus on  data science I am motivated by compelling applications  and some of the areas that I study are personalization  social media  social networks  journalism  and e commerce If you are a prospective student interested to work with me  you need to apply to the CS Ph D  program  If you are already admitted to the program  send me an email with your interests and CV  You may also want to read this article on how to be a successful Ph D  student    n                       apply to the CS Ph D

Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago  Prior to joining UIC  I spent a few years in industry as a data scientist  working on large scale recommender systems  personalization  incentivized sharing  and data science tools for journalists  I built and led the data science team at LivingSocial  and later was a principal data scientist at Vox Media  I also spent a year in government as an AAAS Science   Technology Policy Fellow at the National Science Foundation  contributing to national initiatives at the intersection of data science and public policy  Many of the research problems I am interested to solve are informed by my industry and public policy experience  I received my Ph D  in Computer Science in      from the University of Maryland  College Park where my advisor was Lise
