Students Win Top Awards at   th Annual Engineering EXPO Home        The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  were the big winners at the   th Annual Engineering EXPO on Friday  April     at the UIC Forum  Along with first place finishes in their categories  ECE teams took home both top awards during the expo  which featured     senior design projects in    categories  The expo projects were all geared toward solving real world challenges with topics representing majors from all six departments in the College of Engineering  The teams displayed a wide variety of creativity  ingenuity  teamwork and intelligence during the event as they impressed guest judges from a variety of engineering industries  All of the first place teams were awarded        The team of Lucas Enright  of Willowbrook  Barry Ng  of Chicago  Tyler Parchem  of Lockport  and Anthony Zaprzalka  of Rolling Meadows     for the team  We were ecstatic when we heard our names called for first place  Our project was picked from the entire expo and stood out from all of the other great projects  made this achievement that much more valuable Unlike other devices on the market  their sensor is an all in one device that records and displays several air quality measurements  It has the ability to be interactive and provide useful feedback According to the team  natural gas  smoke and other gases throughout the home  An alarm and LED indicators will alert the residents of any harmful gas concentrations  All the data can be accessed directly from the device where it will be logged and displayed on the LCD screen for the user to view  The data history can also be viewed with any home computer using the internal SD card  The Household Air Quality Sensor will save lives by alerting the residents of any threats to their safety The team of Ramsin Adamz  of Glen Ellyn  Kamil Koziol  of Chicago  Brian Nielsen  of Downers Grove  and Daniel Poarch  of Chicago     for the team  we were overwhelmed with joy and were relieved to have won  that we almost missed the following announcement of the winner of the Innovation award  We feel honored  and rewarded for all the time we put into the project The team designed a tool that has the potential to manage and monitor every device connected to the electric network of a home or an office building  and utilize a combination of hardware and software to analyze and control the electrical network According to the team NFC  technology to enable device recognition  This permits efficient monitoring for Smart Plug aware outlets and devices  The information collected by the outlets will be shared using narrow band communication technologies which operate over existing electrical wiring of the building  This allows the consumer to see real time cost savings in their home or business  The central device can provide automation and switching capabilities to control and reduce power consumption throughout the entire residential or commercial power network Additional ECE first place winners were Mike Cleary  Abdullah Elagha ART  Soroush Kadineh  Omar Khan Find all of the Expo winners and project details here here By David
