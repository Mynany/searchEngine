Students Use Senior Design Projects to Help Community Organizations Home        Senior Design projects are an opportunity for students to show creativity  innovation and talent  Starting the spring term of          students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  took senior design projects a step further by dedicating long hours and hard work to selflessly serve four area nonprofits with their engineering knowledge and skills Instead of working on a project that serves their own self interests  the students volunteered to help Enlace Chicago  Lakeview Pantry  Little Village Environmental Justice Organization  and People for Community Recovery solve problems that substantially address distinct needs in the community that those organizations serve Each of the nonprofits provided a problem statement during the spring      semester  The students worked with the organizations to refine the problem statement and develop a solution  At the end of the spring semester  the teams presented their ideas to the organizations  At the end of the fall      semester  the students presented their completed projects to the organizations during a poster session  Revelo  who directed the course  who is a research coordinator at Little Village Lawndale High School  was excited to see the final project  Enlace was using an iPad and photo booth software for taking pictures at its events  but it had an expensive monthly fee  They wanted something that they could use every day with no outside costs  and use as a learning tool at the high school  Sometimes the kids want to do more with the photo booth  However  the app we had is no longer supported and becoming very expensive  but allows the students to do the coding behind it Along with a functioning app  the UIC students created a manual for any class that wants to modify the photo booth  It will allow them to play around with it  learn from it  and improve the camera sizing or modify it in the future  which is in the Enlace logo  The branding is there and this will help with marketing  Not only are we having events at the high school  but Enlace as a whole is having events in the community where this can be used Apart from saving Enlace money by eliminating a monthly fee  the photo booth will support high school students in other ways  we sold pictures for    and that generated money for other programs or buying material for other clubs  and they do robotics  We would like our students to do not only competitions  but also be involved in this project and be able to teach other students to code  using the new photo booth  The four senior design projects offered the students more than an opportunity to give back to the community  They also posed multiple challenges  The teams had to work with a real client to solve a problem  and some teams consisted of people who did not have previous experience working together  a recent graduate who was part of a team that designed and built a photo booth for Enlace  we just had it taking photos  but we wanted to have some light on it to draw attention to it  Now  we are printing the photos Apart from taking on a challenge as an engineer  the UIC students also learned about the organizations they helped  Revelo views it as an opportunity for the students to give back to the community while building stronger relationships between the ECE department and local organizations  community organizations Learn about all of the projects at ECE News ECE News By David Staudacher  UIC David Staudacher  UIC   Facebook    Twitter
