     Professor Seferoglu Awarded Five Grants Totaling More Than     M  ECE Professor Hulya Seferoglu is on a roll  The prolific researcher was awarded five grants in the recent months for a total of more than      million in research funding  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  professor has received awards from the National Science Foundation  Army Research Lab  Army Research Office  National Institute of Standards and Technology and an industry grant PI  for four of these five awards  Each grant is for a different research project  data  and services away from centralized nodes to the logical extremes of a network  It allows analytics and data gathering to materialize at the source At the edge devices like smartphones or sensors may be attached to your body to check your health  These devices may have demanding functions that will take a significant amount of time to complete However  there are times when an Internet connection is not available  and you cannot connect to the cloud and offload the tasks  Additionally  this can be expensive as there are fees with cellular and Wi Fi connections and cloud services  Overcoming these obstacles is something the professor is taking on  The connectivity to cloud can be lost or compromised  offloading tasks to cloud may increase delay  because tasks should be sent to the cloud  processed there  and the processed tasks should be received back  which may potentially increase delay  Instead of doing all this  I mean your device or the devices around you For military applications  a person may be in the field and they have their smartphone like devices and these devices potentially combine the computing capabilities and do the computationally intensive tasks together  For more civilian applications  multiple devices like smartphones  tablets and your PC can do this together  consider a scenario that smartphone A offloads computationally intensive tasks to smartphone B  but smartphone B can move away  or it may be too slow to process tasks  We would like to make this mechanism more reliable  In particular  we aim to design task offloading mechanisms that take into account dynamics of devices at the edge and their time varying nature With a grant from the Army Research Lab  security is another issue she is taking into high consideration  This is a continuation of her previous research  which focused on the Internet of Battlefield Things  which is the military version of Internet of Things  it may be revealing some information  but I would really like to have this information private  So the question here is while sending these tasks  can I conform to privacy rules  the content of the tasks that I am offloading should not be changed by these devices  This is one of the major challenges Another research project she is working on is robust and resilient networks when there is a natural disaster like a hurricane or mass shooting  their connection may not be good demand network among multiple first responders in the field  which will allow them to communicate better  its reliability is not as much as the infrastructure based network  There are a lot of reliability problems in terms of connectivity Dynamic Heterogeneity Aware Coded Cooperative Computation at the Edge Predictive Edge Computing with Hard Deadlines The Evolving Nature of Disaster Management in the
