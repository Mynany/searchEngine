unpaid tuition and fees or library fines  reasons pertaining to unmet financial aid obligations  academic or disciplinary reasons  or an incomplete medical immunization record A student with a hold on their record may not register  or in many cases  obtain transcripts until the hold is cleared with the office imposing the hold NOTE  BANNER is an integrated database used by all three University of Illinois campuses  UIUC  UIC  and UIS  A hold placed on one campus that affects a student s ability to register will also prevent registration on the other campuses  Therefore  for example  a student with a financial hold from UIUC will not be allowed to register at UIC or UIS until the hold is cleared  This is true of all holds that affect the ability of a student to register Academic Dismissal The Graduate College may drop a student for limited status violations  academic probation  and other requirements such as failing preliminary or other exams  or failure to make satisfactory progress towards the degree  Because BANNER is an integrated database and an academic dismissal hold would prevent registration at the other U or I campuses  students dropped by the Graduate College for academic reasons will have their Academic Standing changed to "Drop" in BANNER  This action prevents registration at the campus where the drop was placed  but since it is technically not a hold  will not prevent future registrations at the other U of I campuses  NOTE  Only the Graduate College can drop a student for academic reasons  If a program wants to have a student dropped for a violation of program rules  failure to progress  limited status violations  etc  the information must be sent to the Dean in the Graduate College for final action Admission Transcripts An applicant may be admitted pending final official transcripts and or mark sheets  When a student admitted on "Pending" status receives the official admission letter  information is included about when to submit the final official documents  If a student matriculates and has not satisfied this requirement after the first term  the Admission Office will place a hold on the student until the needed documents are submitted  These students will not be allowed to register until the hold is removed Advising If a degree program has requested that advising holds are to be placed on students  this hold may only be cleared by that program office  Individual programs may have different requirements to release the hold  but once the student has satisfied the requirement for that term  the department must eliminate the hold in BANNER   Note  Occasionally  a UIC undergraduate who matriculates to the Graduate College will have an undergraduate advising hold erroneously placed on their account after their last undergraduate term  Only the undergraduate college can remove the hold  Similarly  students who transfer between graduate programs may have the same situation occur  The old program must remove the hold to allow the student to register  Rarely  these type of occurrences may happen between the three campuses  The student s former campus must release the hold to allow registration at the new campus  This should only occur for one term Disciplinary If a student is found to be guilty of disciplinary action by the Office of the Dean of Students  a disciplinary hold may be placed by that office for disciplinary action taken Financial Students must clear all past due financial encumbrance before they are allowed to register  A financial hold is not reason to later approve a late registration petition  after the   th day   th in summer  once the hold is eliminated Immunization Illinois state law mandates that all students  born on or after January          entering a postsecondary institution  are required to present documented proof of immunity against measles  mumps  rubella  tetanus  and diphtheria as a prerequisite to registration  Students in the health professions colleges are also required to provide proof of immunity against polio and tuberculosis An immunization hold will be placed on a record if the student is not properly immunized and has not submitted a written statement of medical or religious exemption  Registration will not be permitted until the medical immunization hold has been cleared  A comprehensive immunization record  certified by a health care provider  must be submitted to the Office of Medical Immunization Records prior to the student s appointed registration day Students registering only for off campus courses or for no more than five credit hours are temporarily exempt from the immunization requirements  Prior to registering for on campus courses or for more than five credit hours  students must submit proof of immunity or secure an approved medical or religious exemption Questions pertaining to acceptable proof of immunity may be directed to the Office of Medical Immunization Records  Room       First Floor
