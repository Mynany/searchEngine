n Only a handful of students are awarded scholarships by the Environmental Research and Education Foundation  EREF  This year  a PhD student in the Department of Civil and Materials Engineering was named a recipient This highly competitive and prestigious scholarship recognizes several doctoral students each year working at the forefront of the waste management and engineering field  The winners are selected from an international pool of applicants  Kumar was one of only eight students nationwide selected by the EREF to receive the scholarship in the amount of         for his research  This will ultimately help in designing stable His research offers an alternative to the conventional landfills in the form of bioreactor landfills  In these landfills  the collected chemical liquid derived from waste degradation and other permitted liquids are recirculated into the landfills via recirculation systems to enhance the moisture conditions and accelerate waste degradation  The benefits including enhanced biogas production and early waste stabilization among others Kumar is working with his academic advisor Professor Krishna R  Reddy  the director of the Sustainable Engineering Research Laboratory and the Geotechnical   Geoenvironmental Engineering Laboratory  on a NSF funded project to develop a practical and reliable coupled thermo hydro bio mechanical model that can enable safe design and operation of stable  effective and sustainable engineered landfills Sustainable Engineering Research Laboratory Geotechnical   Geoenvironmental Engineering Laboratory  He works as a graduate research assistant in our lab and makes it a point to be involved in other research projects as well Additionally  Girish assists his lab colleagues working on another NSF funded project that involves mitigating landfill gas emissions using steel slag amended biocover systems  The project proposes an innovative  low cost and practical biogeochemical cover system that utilizes biochar to oxidize landfill methane emissions into carbon dioxide and subsequently sequester carbon dioxide via mineral carbonation using steel slag  thus rendering zero emissions through landfill covers As the President of the Sustainable Remediation Forum student chapter at UIC  Girish is constantly engaged beyond the walls of the laboratory by organizing expert lectures and seminars from academicians and industry professionals to keep himself aware of the technical know how of different fields More information about EREF scholarships can be found at https   erefdn org scholarship program   More
