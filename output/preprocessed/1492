bioengineering department core faculty is complemented by a large cadre of adjunct faculty drawn from almost every College within the University  Liberal Arts and Sciences  Medicine  Applied Health Sciences  Business Administration  Public Health  Dentistry  and Pharmacy EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES    Graduates will compete effectively and favorably with peers from Big Ten universities for positions in industry  professional school  or graduate programs    Graduates will remain active contributors to the field of bioengineering through professional societies  service to scholarly or technical journals  alumni activities  mentoring  contributions to education or human resources  or other activities beyond the basic requirements of their occupation    Graduates will demonstrate leadership in their professions  as evidenced by scholarly and technical publication or other measure of professional productivity  including awards and honors  and advancement within the organizations in which they are employed  as appropriate to the individual career path  The Objectives above are supported by a dynamic curriculum that is updated every two years to meet the needs of our students and other constituencies  industry  graduate programs  and professional programs  This curriculum is designed to allow our students to achieve excellence in fourteen areas  These fourteen Learning Outcomes describe the knowledge  skills and behaviors that students will acquire by completing the Bioengineering curriculum Learning Outcomes MORE ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT The University of Illinois at Chicago  UIC  is one of three campuses in the University of Illinois system  Located in the heart of Chicago  the UIC campus hosts a diverse constituency of students  attracted by the quality of UIC programs and the metropolitan setting  UIC ranks as one of the most diverse institutions in the country  It is the only major state supported Research I institution in the city of Chicago  The Department of Bioengineering at UIC employs a rigorous and energetic process of continuous improvement of its curricula  Historically  graduates of our undergraduate program enter positions in industry    %  professional schools  medicine  dentistry  nursing  pharmacy  law    %  and graduate programs    %  Alumni of our graduate programs have pursued careers in industry  academia  national research labs and medicine UIC Bioengineering traces its roots to      when it started as undergraduate and graduate programs offered by the UI College of Medicine in collaboration with the new UI Chicago Circle  UICC  University and Presbyterian St  Lukes Hospital  which later became Rush Medical University  The graduate program was one of the first ten in the nation to receive an NIH training grant for bioengineering students  In       the undergraduate program was third in the nation to receive ABET accreditation  when ABET came into existence  In       when UI Medicine and UICC merged to form the University of Illinois at Chicago  UIC  the Bioengineering programs became a part of the UIC Department of Bioengineering  housed in Engineering  In      Bioengineering returned to its roots  being the first department at UIC housed in two colleges  Engineering and Medicine  In       in recognition of long time support and Alum of Bioengineering  Richard Hill  and his wife  Loan Hill  the department became the Richard and Loan Hill Department of Bioengineering The department has a tradition of strong programs in cell and tissue engineering  neural engineering  bioinformatics  biomedical imaging  biomechanics and biomolecular engineering and continues to offer excellent opportunities in these research areas  Current enrollment totals over     Doctoral  Ph D  over    Master of Science  and over     undergraduate  Bachelor of Science  students  There are currently twenty full time equivalent core faculty members and over     affiliate faculty members in many departments throughout the Colleges of Liberal Arts   Science  Applied Health Sciences  Dentistry  Engineering  Medicine  Pharmacy  and Nursing The UIC chapters of the Biomedical Engineering Society  BMES  Engineering World Health  EWH  and IEEE Engineering in Medicine   Biology Society  EMBS  are very active  They provide a coordinated outlet for students to meet and discuss topics in Biomedical Engineering and to work together on projects to promote health in the community and around the world using what they are learning in the classroom  In Fall       the first UIC Scientific Undergraduate Research Journal  SURJ  was published  SURJ allows UIC students to engage in scholarly discourse and get an early start on their research careers IMPORTANT LINKS Newsletter Newsletter  UIC
