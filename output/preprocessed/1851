What to Expect To make an appointment at the Counseling Center  simply telephone or walk in to schedule a specific time for an initial appointment  Though availability for the first appointment varies across the year  we do our best to meet with you as soon as possible  The receptionist will speak with you about the reasons you are seeking assistance and will schedule you with an appropriate counselor  If you are experiencing a mental health crisis  please be sure to let us know   If you are not able to use the computer  alternate means to complete these forms can be provided  These forms ask about demographic and contact information  as well as your reasons for pursuing counseling services  You will also be asked to read and sign forms that explain our confidentiality policy and your rights and responsibilities in counseling  In order to ensure there is enough time to complete this process  we ask that you arrive    minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time  After you have completed all forms  this information goes to the receptionist  who will make them available to your scheduled counselor to review before your session text block After reviewing your completed paperwork  a counselor will meet you in the waiting room and walk with you to their office to speak in private  The purpose of the first session at the Counseling Center is to assess your concerns and to develop a plan of how to address those concerns  During your meeting with the counselor  you will have a chance to briefly describe why you are seeking assistance and why you have chosen this particular time to do so  The counselor will ask for information about your present situation  your family background  general health and self care  and important relationships in your life  You may be asked to discuss past experiences with this or similar problems and how you have tried to solve them  They will also explain and answer your questions about the counseling process  UIC students may request this intake consultation  but not all students are offered ongoing treatment at the counseling center  If further services would be beneficial  these will be discussed  and a recommendation will be made by the counselor  These additional services may include resources offered by the Counseling Center or referral to another campus or community resource  In many instances  the counselor that you meet with initially could be the same person that you see for continued services  or you may be referred to another counselor at the center  Please note that  due to limited availability of our psychiatrist  we cannot offer medication management as a stand alone service  Only clients who will be pursuing some form of psychotherapy at the center are eligible for medication evaluation and or medication management  there may be a brief wait for an opening for the desired service  depending on the general demand at that time for that service  Your counselor will assess the urgency of your situation and this will be considered when making the recommendation of where  when and with whom you would best pursue further treatment Confidentiality Your privacy is a top priority for us  We understand that many students have concerns about personal information or identities shared in counseling being shared with others  Matters shared with Counseling Services staff are kept private within the Counseling Center unless you give your counselor written permission to release specific information  This means that visits here are not part of your academic record  nor are they a part of any medical record you may have at campus medical facilities  such as at UIC Family Medicine Services Services  n nBack to main content n n n n n n Back to main content Individual Counseling Group
