career  Networking Tips What is networking  Networking is simply a word to describe connecting with people in your chosen professional field You probably network regularly without realizing it  e g  speaking with professors about your career goals  meeting a recruiter at a career fair and following up with a LinkedIn connection request Why is networking important  Believe it or not  That means that a majority of your job searching time should be spent networking as many as   % of new jobs are never posted online Is it weird or inappropriate to approach strangers to ask for help  Not at all  Most working professionals have obtained at least one job or internship through networking  Engineers and other professionals have been in your shoes before  and some will be happy to help you  Not everyone will be receptive or have time to give you advice  so  move on to someone else Where and with whom can I network  Your network is a lot bigger than you think  Anybody you have ever met is part of your network  friends  neighbors  co workers  professors  and classmates  People who interview you are part of your network  Even some people you have never met are part of your network  including UIC alumni  The amount of networking opportunities available to you are only limited by your willingness and ability to simply talk to people UIC alumni You can network at real time events  including career fairs  trade shows  networking focused happy hour events  student org meetings  Career Center employer events  or virtually over email and LinkedIn  Check out events both on  and off campus to talk to people who are working in your desired field s How can I be a successful networker  How can I network virtually  For networking virtually through email or LinkedIn  Sample Message
