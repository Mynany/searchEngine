Policies Educational Policy Student Academic Grievance Policy       UIC  Academic Grievance process that is fair  takes a reasonable amount of time  and provides the Student with requisite levels of due process  Across UIC  the Academic Grievance process will include at least three stages      the Student makes a sincere attempt to resolve their complaint informally with the Respondent        the Student Grievant files a formal Academic Grievance with the appropriate Administrative Officer  AO  or their designee  which the AO attempts to resolve  and     she he they may appeal the decision to the appropriate Grievance Officer  GO  or where the Student has alleged that a significant procedural error s  occurred in the Academic Grievance process that could substantially affect the outcome of the decision  In these cases  the Chancellor or their designee will review the record and issue a decision Depending on the type of decision that is being grieved  the GO  or their designee  may make a decision independently or may convene a hearing  For Academic Grievances of serious adverse decisions  Level    that will prevent a Student from continuing their progress toward a degree in good academic standing  GOs are required to convene a three person Hearing Panel and conduct a Formal Hearing  For Level   academic grievances  related to academic decisions that will not prevent a Student from continuing their progress toward a degree in good academic standing  all grievances may be considered  except those involving grades or evaluations that are entirely based on a subjective judgment by a University agent  unless the grievance involves an allegation of unlawful discrimination or sexual misconduct To guide the implementation of this policy  a procedures document will outline the expectations for each stage  the responsibilities of the AO and GO  and timelines  The Grievant will be notified about the process for filing a formal Academic Grievance  deadlines for each stage  If there is a claim of unlawful discrimination and or sexual misconduct  the Office for Access and Equity will review the complaint  conduct an investigation of the unlawful discrimination and or sexual misconduct as appropriate  determine findings  and advise the AO and GO throughout the process To allow for flexibility across UIC level policies and procedures in place that outline how the three stages of the process will be implemented  given the specific context of the college  Colleges may further extend or enhance the process in accordance with related accreditation or professional standards  Students must be notified about college level academic grievance procedures through student handbooks and or through program websites  These college specific academic grievance procedures will be submitted to the Provost Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for review and approval For undergraduate and professional students  all three stages of the process will remain in their academic college with the appeal to the Chancellor  as described above  the first two stages of the process  informal and AO  will reside in the academic college  with the third stage  GO  moving to the Graduate College  For graduate students filing Level   academic grievances  all three stages of the process will remain in their academic college  Again  for all cases filed by graduate students  the appeal to the Chancellor is limited as set forth above  All colleges must report the number of academic grievances filed to the Provost Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs annually  as well as any college specific modifications to the student academic grievance procedures implemented in the previous year  UIC has not previously issued a formal policy indicating that students have the right to grieve adverse academic decisions  The goals with the current policy are to ensure that     a single person makes a single decision  e g  the policy and updated procedures prohibit the Administrative Officer from serving as Grievance Officer or as a member of the Hearing Panel   and     to allow the process to vary for undergraduate  graduate  and professional students to accommodate various college structures or college level procedures that supplement the UIC procedures  staff  or faculty  faculty  staff  and administrators Definitions  Student Academic Grievance
