Repairing Rwanda Home        here  On May     the new Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  ECE  alumnus flew to Rwanda with Engineering World Health  EWH  for a two month project  where he used his talent to repair medical equipment During the first month of the project he was in the city of Kigali  where he underwent training to on how to repair medical equipment  while learning the local language and brushing up on the French he learned in high school  Jeff Chininis from the University of Missouri  and I were able to do a substantial amount of work at Gihundwe Hospital  where we ended up getting placed  of Lemont  Ill  they had a ton of equipment waiting for us  We repaired centrifuges  oxygen concentrators  suction machines  power tools  a maternity bed  and even a coffee machine One of the first tools to be repaired was a broken jigsaw  Shubert faced a new problem  How is he going to fix it   But the old centrifuge they had in the corner had carbon brushes  So we removed those  cut them in half  and stuck them in the jigsaw  And it worked perfectly The power tools they fixed allowed maintenance workers and technicians to perform their day to day tasks  With this one tool repaired  the technicians were able to continue making prosthetic limbs for patients with missing limbs While the easy going engineer is modest about his work at the hospital  there is one project that he gets excited about and is proud to discuss in detail The above ground tank supplied the entire hospital with water  which posed several problems  The pump had to be manually turned on and off to fill the tank  It also meant the hospitals maintenance staff were on call      to turn the pump on and off  The staff told Shubert about being woken up at odd hours to go to the hospital for the bothersome task  and it was done for less than      several of the technicians from other Rwandan hospitals expressed interest in having one of their own To accommodate their requests  he developed a PCB file that they could use to print their own circuit boards at a new makerspace in Kigali  He also provided a technical manual detailing how the circuit works  instructions for installing the system  and how to troubleshoot it if a problem arises  but a very rewarding experience existent internet connectivity were a stark contrast to what I was familiar with in the States  Before graduating  Shubert served as the electrical lead for the UIC  The project is based off a one week site assessment in Vietnam  where two team members visited local pediatric hospitals and medical facilities in order to improve healthcare delivery using low cost solutions  During the evaluation of the sterility of one of the hospitals  it was discovered that the infection rates were extremely high due to medications being compounded in an open air environment  To change this  the UIC students decided that a laminar flow hood was needed in order to provide the hospital staff with a sterile environment for mixing medications  Apart from improving hospital conditions  the project won the Maurice Prize Competition  which included a        monetary award  and when an electrical problem came up  I had to solve it  which forces you to learn  the things we made help people directly The UIC student chapter of EWH inspires and mobilizes the engineering community to improve the quality of health care in vulnerable communities of the developing world  The students achieve their mission through innovation and strong alliances with partners  EWH is a global organization serving engineering students  healthcare professionals  communities around the world  and patients in need  It inspires  educates and empowers young engineers  scientists and medical professionals from more developed parts of the world to use their skills to improve global health  EWH offers young professionals an eye opening  life changing experience that encourages life long engagement with global health  and enables them immediately to provide meaningful service to patients in the developing world Shubert has been part of two major extracurricular engineering experiences at UIC  one which was made possible with support from the ECE department  Now  the alumnus is at Johns Hopkins University for graduate school  where he plans to continue working with medical devices Learn more about the
