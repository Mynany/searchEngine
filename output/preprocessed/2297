Prolific Pair Awarded Scholarships from IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society Home        Two prolific ECE students were recently awarded scholarships from the Chicago Chapter of the IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society  Seiran Khaledian  a second year Ph D  student  was awarded        and Farhad Farzami  a third year Ph D  student  received      for their achievements in research  Khaledian is a very bright student  who is making very good progress in her research with a lot of potential for success  who is the director of the Andrew Electromagnetics Laboratory at UIC  I know that she is an excellent student because she has taken two courses with me and she received an A grade in both of them  Khaledian has a very dedicated and sincere approach towards her research  IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters  and IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters She has been making very good progress and has co authored five publications during her tenure at UIC  In addition  she is part of a team working on a new journal paper  Her research activity is focused on self interference cancellation  which is a very important and timely topic for applications in wireless communication systems  the existence of self interference causes a reduction of the performance of full duplex and half duplex wireless communication systems  who is an IEEE Fellow and Editor in Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation journal interference using digital techniques  However  what distinguishes the research of Ms  Khaledian is that she is interested in an analog approach at the level of the RF front end and the antenna  In fact  an approach that includes an analog component is needed to achieve the levels of self interference  which are required for the applications she is considering Farzami has been working on the design of reconfigurable dual band reflection amplifiers  He has co authored four journal articles in IEEE publications  one in an Elsevier publication  and    conference presentations  he is a very hard working person  and he is making very good progress in his research activities According to the professor interference cancellation for full duplex communication systems  The importance of full duplex communication systems is that they use the same frequency band for both transmitting and receiving  which is an improvement over ordinary communication systems where two different frequency bands are used  As a result  full duplex system have the potential to double the capacity of the communication channel and make better usage of the available frequency spectrum  However  there is a major electromagnetic compatibility challenge to address in the realization of a full duplex system  the cancellation of the strong self interference of the transmitted signal on the received one  Farzami is an excellent student  as I have directly observed in two courses that he took with me       GPA  As a teaching assistant ECE      and next summer we are planning to prepare a new laboratory for the technical elective course on Electromagnetic Compatibility  ECE      tools and techniques for reducing electromagnetic interference  measurement techniques and test procedures  instrumentation  equipment and systems characteristics  interference control techniques and components  education  computational analysis  and spectrum management  along with scientific  technical  industrial  professional or other activities that contribute to this field By David Staudacher  UIC   Facebook
