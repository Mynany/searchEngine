stronger desire to make the world a better place  It is this drive that helped the Department of Civil and Materials Engineering student win a Chicago Consular Corps  CCC  Scholarship for the academic year      OIA She is one of only a several successful applicants university     scholarship  Eligibility for the scholarship is limited to students who have a minimum cumulative UIC GPA of      on a   point scale Chetri  of Nepal  is working under the direction of CME Professor Krishna R  Reddy in the Sustainable Engineering Research Lab and the Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering Lab where they are working on developing an innovative steel slag biochar soil cover for municipal solid waste landfills to mitigate fugitive landfill emissions  Landfills are the major sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gases  and developing steel slag  biochar amended soil cover will prove a turning point in the field of landfills and steel industry  It will not only hold in emissions from landfills but also solve one of the biggest problems of steel industry which is stockpiling of waste slag developing an innovative steel slag biochar soil cover for municipal solid waste landfills to mitigate fugitive landfill emissions solving skills  She is very hard working and sincere towards her work  has in depth knowledge on the subject matters and possess the ability to conduct research independently  and has excellent analytical skills  She is highly motivated and inclined towards learning new things  and takes the initiative to conduct in depth literature reviews  In her short span of research at UIC  she has been able to write nearly    technical papers  which includes journal and conference papers  She takes criticisms positively and takes them as an opportunity to improve  She strives to flourish as an accomplished researcher Apart from her outstanding work in the classroom and the laboratory  she has a drive to help others  This is something that started a young age and motivates her as a student  all I saw was poor infrastructure  poor health facilities and many people dying at an early age  I understood one simple fact that the main reason for many people dying at an early age was lack of health facilities and infrastructures  There were no proper roads and transportation facilities to carry sick people to the far away hospitals on time  I developed immense curiosity at an early age to find out more about the causes and solutions to such events  Gradually  I realized that engineering was the solution I was looking for to help the people of my village The Chicago Consular Corps  CCC  is comprised of all career and honorary consular officials appointed by their respective governments to serve in metropolitan Chicago  and who are duly recognized by the United States Department of State  Since its founding  the CCC has united representatives from countries around the world with more than    countries represented According to the CCC  graduate and doctoral work  This is an important issue that is a core value to the CCC and to send the message to the foreign students  that we appreciate  admire and support their efforts and the sacrifice that it represents to them and their families to strive for a better education  GAGEL uic edu graduate studies http   cme uic edu graduate studies  UIC David Staudacher  UIC  n nFacebook n  n nTwitter n  n
