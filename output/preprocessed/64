Mission UIC will take advantage of and build upon its diversity to create  share  and apply knowledge that prepares people for citizenship in a changing global society  The diversity of the members of our campus community will be apparent and  moreover  UIC will be known as an institution of higher education where diversity is a cornerstone of intellectual achievement  As a truly diverse institution  UIC will engage citizens from all the communities of Chicago and all the many other communities that comprise the state which we serve  n nDiversity Strategic Plan n  n nDiversity Strategic Plan n Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change UIC is one of the most diverse campuses in the United States and a great place to study  learn  work  and prepare for the global interdependence of people and markets  The seven Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change are a collaborative group that aims to make UIC a welcoming and inclusive place for all students  faculty and staff  The Centers are committed to student success  intercultural engagement  vibrant scholarship  and dynamic community partnerships  n      Learn more n     Diversity Education While the presence of numerically diverse students  faculty  representational diversity is not an airborne virus whose mere presence spreads the beneficial outcomes of diversity  Representational diversity is a resource that must be intelligently and intentionally drawn on to be appreciated and ultimately produce positive outcomes  Representational diversity is but the first step in a spectrum of intentional efforts designed to maximize the benefits of diversity by incorporating it in our living  teaching  learning  research and public service  r n r nGoal   calls for systemic change to the ways we regard and reward diversity work by faculty and students and the way in which we assess academic programs  We expect students to learn more about diversity  and faculty and staff will have opportunities  methods  and resources for developing diversity competencies  New vehicles for communicating about diversity will be offered as will resources for encouraging collaboration among researchers and practitioners of diversity  n n              Words Matter  n              n n              Inclusive Classroom n              n n              Dialogue Initiative n             Data and Research Many are attracted to UIC by its diversity  but simple exposure to difference cannot transform our campus into a thriving community that values difference  Everyone at UIC must consciously and deliberately work to create an environment that welcomes varied identities if we are to create a community distinguished by principles and practices of diversity  equity  and social justice  Goal   focuses on our interactions with  and understandings of each other  both of which are needed if we are to fully appreciate the contributions of others  The ultimate goal of creating a climate of diversity and equity is not to make everybody feel good about themselves  Rather  the goal is to build a culture in which individuals are poised for the pursuit of excellence and offered many and varied opportunities to achieve it  r n r nWe must begin by knowing our campus climate as it truly is  UIC will assess the climate experienced by its staff  students  and faculty by means of a periodically reiterated survey  When we identify shortcomings  we will design solutions  Climate surveys will make a special point of considering accessibility issues that impact equal participation in and enjoyment of campus life by all individuals  including those with disabilities  UIC will strive to implement principles of universal design in physical planning of space and facilities    n n

foundational to our institutional culture  we further state our commitment to diversity  which must extend beyond policies and statements  to ensure our campus climate is such that all our community members feel welcomed and valued  The values articulated below and in the diversity strategic thinking report  Through the Lens of Diversity  Our values must be infused in every aspect of the work of the university  n n              Internal Resources n              n n              External Resources n              n n              Undocumented Student Resource n             Diversity News and
