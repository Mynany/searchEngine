Telephonics Telephonics is a New York based corporation with       employees  and a      million annual revenue specialized in ISR  radar and tactical communication systems solutions  Lo Monte is

University of Dayton  where he taught courses on radar and electronic warfare  and served many U S  Department of Defense government agencies Lo Monte also was appointed as the Topical Editor for the IEEE Sensors Journal  as a representative to the Aerospace and Electronics Systems  AES  Board of Governor  and is an AES Distinguished Lecturer  and his success is great news  Rashid Ansari  ECE Department Head  too  Italy  who is the director of the Andrew Electromagnetics Laboratory at UIC  He was at the top of the class  at UIC  very professional and detailed oriented  I am very happy for him Lo Monte said he had a great experience at UIC  which prepared him for the working world in many different ways  which is deep and thorough enough to prepare you seamlessly for any technical job  In the high tech industry  being worldly and cosmopolitan is paramount for success  Diversity and inclusion help you to understand and interface with the world  Differently from many other universities  UIC has a very diverse student body and culture  At UIC  I started my professional networking with people from all over the world and all backgrounds  This network  nurtured through the years  allowed me to expand my knowledge  social understanding and wisdom  the ECE faculty members had a profound impact on the young Ph D  student D  research assistant  the entire ECE faculty acted like a family to me  proactively ready to listen to my technical  and personal  concerns  This amiable and accommodating environment helped me focus solely on my research and Ph D While the      graduate has achieved a great deal of success in his young career outside of UIC  he still has strong ties to the ECE department D  advisor  Professor Danilo Erricolo  We wrote grants and publications together long after my Ph D  was completed  and we share common interests with the IEEE  I have been collaborating with former UIC Ph D  students  such as Pawan Setlur  Harun Hayvaci  and Stefano Canta  who have also achieved great success in their respective careers While Lo Monte has a bright future ahead of himself  he still reflects on his time at UIC with strong fondness  Life at the campus  nearby the campus  and in the adjacent downtown are unparalleled  both technical and social  that I had at UIC has been so far the most important of my life  and I will cherish these memories forever  yet ephemeral time at UIC Learn more about ECE at www ece uic edu www ece uic edu By David Staudacher  UIC David Staudacher   Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus    Linkedin    Tumblr    Email
