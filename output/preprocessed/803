UIC menu UIC edu Campus Map UIC Welcomes the Disability Cultural Center Nothing About Us  Without Us The University of Illinois at Chicago  UIC  welcomes the much anticipated Disability Cultural Center  DCC  on its campus  Led by Roxana Stupp  former Director of the Disability Resource Center  DRC  the DCC strives to support and foster community building among students  staff  and faculty who identify as persons with disabilities or as disabled  Joining the Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change  the DCC is open to all who are interested in its mission and initiatives  Currently located on the first floor of the Richard J  Daley Library  the DCC opened its doors to the public on September           Carrie Sandahl  with a presentation entitled "What is Disability Culture   and performances by leading Chicago artists with disabilities  including Nura Aly  Timotheus Gordon  Arlene Malinowski  Kris Lenzo  and Anita Kenney Disability Cultural Center  DCC  Disability Resource Center  DRC Dr  Carrie Sandahl A Brief History  the Disability Resource Center  DRC  became part of the Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change  CCUSC  Informed by an understanding of disability as a part of diversity  this move aimed to address the clear need for a center that focused on the disability perspective  As DCC Director Roxana Stupp explained   The broader perspective  the larger picture  is to not only open a space for students  but also have an open space for staff and faculty  Accessibility   alongside  human diversity  is about the commitment of the University to add accessibility to equity  To me it was important to put the two things together The desire to create a community space for persons with disabilities on campus  as well as the legal necessity to accommodate students in the classroom  led to further conversations during the           academic year about how to best meet these needs  As Caryn Bills  Associate Chancellor for the Office for Access and Equity  OAE  staff  and students  are  a legal requirement  which is for students with disabilities that have to be accommodated in the academic environment OAE  in order to deal exclusively with accommodations  and the DCC was created in late February of       under the Office of Diversity  with the goal of providing greater resources for programming and other support for people with disabilities on campus Office for Access and Equity  OAE Quote   Disability is a human experience  It was a great moment on campus to also start talking about disability as diversity The DCC was thus conceptualized as a further resource for people with disabilities to create and share a safe and informative space  DCC staff and PhD student in Disability Studies adds  and these are also part of the experience that we want to bring into the center  We want everyone to be here and meet with us Brian Heyburn  also a DCC staff and PhD student in Disability Studies  states that intersectionality is very important to the work of the DCC  Crenshaw  intersectionality refers to the ways in which intersecting forms of oppression are experienced  in our center and our work  we are sensitive of the broader experience of identity  One of the goals of the DCC is to highlight the intersections among disability and other social identities  and to explore these connections through art and cultural programming in collaboration with the various Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change at UIC S  Regarding this  This means that we are part of the Office of Diversity and answer directly to the Chancellor and the Provost  In that respect our location really projects to the rest of the University  The fact that UIC is a model that embraces this initiative at the highest level of administration is a great opportunity that we have  We have a lot to do now to develop our vision for this center  but we are in the right place because we can communicate with other students through our connection to the other Cultural Centers Quote   We want to be sure that  in our center and our work  we are sensitive of the broader experience of identity Disability Resource  Disability Cultural Being a new resource for people with disabilities  the DCC will continue to work alongside the DRC to expand services for students  staff  and faculty  For instance  the DCC and DRC would like to see the development of a mentoring program for incoming undergraduate students  Through such an initiative  Stupp explains  discrimination  and stigma in the classroom and that is really closely connected to culture  Not everything is about accommodation At the DRC  the staff is happy to see the DCC opening their doors to students  faculty  and staff  and those that are serving at the Cultural Center  Associate Chancellor for the Office for Access and Equity  OAE Danielle Earls  Assistant Director for the Office of Access and Equity  also notes the importance of the new cultural center  gather  or just hang out  while the DCC are focusing on that cultural component Communication and collaboration between the DRC and the DCC will remain essential as both units seek to better serve the disability community at UIC  As Earls explains  we can work with the DCC where students who are part of that community would be ready to volunteer to give services in another way  There are also people that inquire about student groups or opportunities to create them specifically around an identity whether it is a specific disability like autism or ADHD  I think that the DRC can help in building that with the DCC  it can be specific to your identity  I see a great collaboration to offer those services that might not fall under the umbrella of compliance accommodations The DRC is committed to supporting an environment where students feel like they can successfully navigate the university setting and work on building a shared identity  Earls also credits student advocates for the changes that are happening on campus Programming and Further Collaboration Since its establishment  the DCC has been busy planning various initiatives and programming series  open  and respectful dialogue while continuing to further critical understandings of disability In Our Own Words  Conversations Matter  Bad Kings by Susan Nussbaum  in art as well as life  but also is a really great read up on September   th  This is meant as a flexible reading space where students come and talk about the themes addressed in the books and explore how portrayals of people with disabilities may or may not resonate Disability Page Turners  first meet up Beyond these various initiatives  As noted by Heyburn  Also  Disability Studies has its roots in disability activism  I see a Disability Cultural Center  in some ways  as an application of Disabilities Studies scholarship Both Heyburn and Diego note that Disability Studies is a profoundly interdisciplinary field  attracting scholars from a variety of disciplines who are interested in exploring the experiences of people with disabilities  while placing disability within social  political  and economic contexts  the program on Disability Art  Culture  and Humanities  PDACH  directed by Dr  Carrie Sandahl  has played a central role in bringing disability art to campus through its engagement with Bodies of Work  In conjunction with Dr  Arts  and Design      s to Today  Department of Disability and Human Development  Disability Art  Culture  and Humanities  PDACH  Gallery     Chicago Disability Activism  Arts  and Design      s to Today Reaching the broader UIC community is also an important aspect of the work at the DCC  and staff is currently putting together a lecture series addressing topics related to disability  n      To learn more about the Disability Cultural Center  please visit their website at  n      n nUIC Logo n n n n UIC Logo  n          Office of the Vice Provost for
