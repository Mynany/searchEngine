b'Student Services and Resources'
b'The Urban Health Program has positively impacted my undergraduate academic career at UIC. The UHP staff has provided me with the privilege of receiving merit based scholarships, participating in summer internships, volunteering at non-profit organizations and shadowing health science professionals at the University of Illinois Hospital, which has enabled me to realize that my true passion is healthcare and that I should pursue a career in the field of nursing. The UHP staff genuinely cares about me as an individual and wants to see me succeed inside of the classroom as well as outside in the professional world as a mature healthcare professional. I am very proud to be apart of the UIC Urban Health Program family and thankful for their support.'
