b'Department of Surgery and Surgical Specialties'
b'The Department of Surgery and Surgical Specialties encompasses the broad specialty of Surgery along with Anesthesiology and Emergency Medicine.'
b'Message from the Chair'
b'Welcome to the Department of Surgery and Surgical Specialties at the University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford.'
b'This is a large academic surgery department dedicated to education since its inception in 1972. It has steadily grown during the past four decades. Our strength is in the ever- increasing number of volunteer and part-time faculty who are extremely generous in sharing their knowledge, expertise, experience and practice facilities for education. They are highly committed to educate the future physicians of this city, state and county.'
b'Our educational programs are designed to offer a strong foundation of basics at the junior level and build further on this foundation at more senior levels. A multitude of educational and skills training activities are aimed toward producing well-educated, compassionate and caring physicians with excellent clinical skills, judgment, technical abilities and attributes of professionalism. As one progresses from junior to more advanced levels, opportunities become available for elective assignments in specialties. Many of our faculty are also engaged in research and, therefore, opportunities may be available to get involved.'
b'We are particularly eager and excited to counsel, guide and assist those who want to pursue a career in any one of the many specialties under our oversight.'

b'Mission'
b'The primary mission of the Department of Surgery and Surgical Specialties is to provide a foundation of learning experiences and a supportive environment in which third- and fourth-year medical students can acquire an understanding of basic principles of surgical diagnosis and treatment for general surgery, the surgical sub-specialties, anesthesiology and emergency medicine.\xc2\xa0 This foundation of knowledge and certain skills are designed for all medical students, regardless of the discipline they may ultimately select.\xc2\xa0 It will include opportunities to encourage the development of skills necessary to become a lifelong independent learner as well as the development of skills and attitudes expected of a physician.\xc2\xa0 Another component of our mission is to provide surgical exposure and experience to the trainees of the family medicine residency training program.\xc2\xa0 The department constantly searches for innovative methods to ensure the accomplishment of these goals.'
b'A secondary mission is to develop research into clinical surgical care and educational methodology followed by dissemination of innovative findings.\xc2\xa0 This will be of benefit to the department, the campus, the college, the university and the community at large.\xc2\xa0 Above all, this will benefit our patients who rely on our competence, capability, care, compassion and professionalism.'
