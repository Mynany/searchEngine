b'Following Up & Thank You Messages'
b' '
b'If you really want to increase your chances of hearing back on\xc2\xa0positions you applied for or hoping to build a better relationship with that person you met at a networking event, you must follow up!

When following up, make sure to clearly show your intentions confidently and not aggressively.'

b'Sometimes it is hard to find the right person to follow up with at an employer you have submitted your resume to. This is where LinkedIn becomes a big help.

Some of these alumni may work at\xc2\xa0organizations where you would like to become an intern or full-time employee. UIC alumni can be a great way to\xc2\xa0network your way into a company, before a job is even posted.'
