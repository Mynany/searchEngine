b'ECE Professor Igor Paprotny has been award two grants. He received a new two-year National Science Foundation (NSF) grant of $246,484 for a project entitled \xe2\x80\x9cEAGER: Opto-Radiometric Powered Untethered MEMS Microfliers.\xe2\x80\x9d The award runs from April 1, 2016, to March 31, 2018. \xe2\x80\x9cDespite the existence of microscale flying insects, aerial microrobots have not been previously investigated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paprotny. \xe2\x80\x9cThis project will validate the feasibility of achieving untethered, controlled opto-radiometric microscale flight. The results will pave the way for a new class of aerial microrobots with applications such as surveillance, microassembly, airborne pollution monitoring and airborne threat detection.\xe2\x80\x9d Paprotny will receive $107,000 in funding from Aclima, Inc. on July 16 for his project \xe2\x80\x9cDevelopment of Low-cost/Low-power Selective MWCNT Methane Sensor.\xe2\x80\x9d Learn more about Dr. Paprotny\xe2\x80\x99s research at Paprotny Laboratory.'
