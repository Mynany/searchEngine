b'\r\n                The UIC Interactive Campus Map was launched in August 2014 and displays a wide array of information resources for UIC\xe2\x80\x99s students, visitors, faculty and staff.  It provides university building and parking information, assists with directions, outlines UIC shuttle routes and provides high-resolution, print-optimized campus maps in PDF format available for download.\r\n                \n\r\n                The map was developed by the Office of Capital Planning and Project Management and UIC graduate students in collaboration with Academic Computing and Communications Center, Office of Public and Government Affairs and other campus units using Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) with a custom designed map overlay. Feedback may be provided using the \xe2\x80\x9cFeedback\xe2\x80\x9c link found on the bottom of the map.\r\n            '
