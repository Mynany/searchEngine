b'Thesis Manual'
b'The\xc2\xa0Thesis Manual was prepared by the Graduate College to provide guidance for the student and advisor in the formal preparation of the thesis, and should be consulted before the student begins\xc2\xa0compiling the document.\xc2\xa0While there are a number of format and presentation requirements that should be followed, the Graduate College allows\xc2\xa0for deviations for accepted disciplinary manuscript practices, and the guidelines allow\xc2\xa0flexiblity for many of these deviations.\xc2\xa0 Consult the manual for more information, and also consult with your advisor and department.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A checklist is provided in the back of the Thesis Manual, and it\xc2\xa0 should be carefully reviewed.'
b'Thesis Manual'
b'Policy on Non-English Theses and Dissertations'
b'Theses and dissertations should be submitted in English (excluding quotes in another language).\xc2\xa0 On occasion, other languages may be used when there are sound academic reasons.\xc2\xa0 Read the Gradaute College Policy on non-English Theses and Dissertations.\xc2\xa0 The title page and abstract must always be in English.'

b'Thesis/Dissertation Questions'
b"The Thesis Manual (see above) should be consulted\xc2\xa0on questions of format.\xc2\xa0 Additional questions should be directed to your advisor, Director of Graduate Studies, or program thesis coordinator since the format is mainly approved by the program.\xc2\xa0 Issues\xc2\xa0that the Thesis Manual may not fully address and\xc2\xa0that your program can't answer, as well as questions on the submission of the thesis to the Graduate College not stated in the manual, may be addressed to the Thesis Coordinator in the Graduate College.\xc2\xa0 (See\xc2\xa0Graduation and Deadlines\xc2\xa0for the term deadlines.)"
