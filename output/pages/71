b'Applications are now being accepted for the new master of science in supply chain and operations management launched by the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Business Administration Liautaud Graduate School. The graduate degree program will begin classes on the UIC campus in spring 2019.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe creation of the master of science in supply chain and operations management degree is a reflection of our commitment to empower students with a dynamic, proven business education, and an immersive city experience full of opportunities that reflect today\xe2\x80\x99s demanding and changing business environment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Mikhail, dean of the College of Business Administration. \xe2\x80\x9cFurthermore, our students receive the key combination of innovative curriculum and world-class faculty instruction at a value price point to yield a high-value return on investment.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The UIC Business master of science in supply chain and operations management is a 32-credit-hour program that includes 16 hours of required courses and 16 credit hours of electives. The goal is to provide functional knowledge in the areas of integrating analytical modeling approaches; enterprise systems; data, analytics and business intelligence; and developing leadership skills within a global context.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEnterprises are seeking supply chain professionals having a confluence of skill sets in the areas of data and analytics, enterprise systems and technology, and domain knowledge of supply chain functions and related operational processes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Matthew Liotine, UIC clinical associate professor of information and decision sciences.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAligning with the present trends, we designed the UIC master of science in supply chain and operations management degree program to fulfill the staffing needs of firms seeking individuals having these skills and this kind of knowledge base.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The program is designed to prepare students for varied work roles, from supply chain planner to manager; logistics coordinator; pricing analyst; procurement specialist; and quality officer, among others.'
b'It develops a strong background for supply chain and operations roles in a range of fields, including manufacturing, transportation and logistics, retail, distribution, to pharmaceutical and personal products, health and medical, and food and software systems. As an innovative hub for logistics, UIC is one of only 11 universities in the U.S. named a SAP Next-Gen Chapter, empowering students with technology best practices and future-focused insights.'
b'The curriculum features courses in supply chain management, global sourcing and logistics, and applied supply chain strategy and practice. It also incorporates a practicum capstone experience course where students work with a client organization to resolve supply chain and operations issues.'
b'The prerequisites to apply include at least one course in managerial statistics or equivalent. Undergraduates with a business degree are welcome to apply, as well as working professionals looking to enhance their skills and capabilities in this field.'
b'Those who have completed an eligible UIC undergraduate degree might also qualify for preferred admission, waiving the need for taking a standardized graduate exam, Liotine said. Some additional perks include certifications and recognitions that can be obtained depending on the courses taken.'
