b'Professional Achievements'
b'Prof. Ben-Arie has performed wide scholarly activities in the areas of computer vision, object and human motion recognition, image processing, neural networks and human audition. These activities resulted in more than 130 scientific publications. Prof. Ben-Arie has successfully completed more than 17 research projects funded by NSF, DARPA, ARO, ONR, Whitaker Foundations and others. For his scholarly work, he received the University of Illinois Scholar award for 2002-2005 (this is the highest research award in University of Illinois).'
b'In his scientific work, he had many discoveries that resulted in broader impact on the area of image analysis. Dr. Ben-Arie discovered the widely cited probabilistic peaking effects of viewed angles and distances, which is the basis of the area of probabilistic image understanding. He also developed the Affine Invariant Spectral Signatures (AISS) and the Volumetric Frequency Representation (VFR). The AISS and the VFR provide novel and efficient means for object and face recognition and shape matching.'
b'Prof. Ben-Arie performed research and service to the community also in the area of Image Processing where he served as an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. In this area, he developed the non-orthogonal EXpansion Matching method (EXM), which is very useful in the recognition of highly occluded objects and in motion video compression.'
b'Prof. Ben-Arie also specializes in the area of human motion and video databases. In this area he recently developed a breakthrough method for recognition of human activities from video based on Indexing and Sequencing (RISq). Only few sparse samples of the video are necessary for almost 100% recognition. The method is a general vector sequence recognition and can be used for other applications such as speech recognition. It is currently patent pending.'
