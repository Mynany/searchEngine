b'Written Critique and Presentation: Framework and Guidelines'
b'The purpose of the Written Critique and Presentation (WCP) is to demonstrate the student\xe2\x80\x99s ability to analyze, evaluate and present an existing body of research (normally but not necessarily) in the area in which they intend to carry out their dissertation work.\xc2\xa0 The WCP should be completed in the student\xe2\x80\x99s second year in the program (completion date is approximately half way through the 4th semester).'

b'WCP Committee Form'
b'In cases where the WCP topic falls in the student\xe2\x80\x99s main research area, there may be substantial overlap between the written critique and the Related Work section of the thesis proposal and/or thesis. This is acceptable.'
b'A conference paper, master\xe2\x80\x99s thesis, etc. cannot simply be submitted verbatim as a substitute for the WCP. However, parts of prior written work on which the student is the sole author may be re-used as the basis for part or all of a WCP paper. Details should be negotiated between the student and their WCP committee chair.'
