b'* Reimbursements are no longer allowed, all purchases must be handled through the department, see Budget & Purchasing Supplies below.'
b' All Bioengineering undergradudate students must take the two-semester Senior Design course sequence, BIOE 396/397, toward the end of their curriculum. These courses are intended to give students experience managing a project from start to finish, and applying their course knowledge to real-life design challenges. Specific course objectives include: system or component design, applying standard engineering practices, project management skills, teamwork, and both written and oral communication skills. '

b'1) PROPOSE YOUR PROJECT'
b'Although most projects are already pre-arranged, occasionally students take initiative and identify their own project and/or sponsor.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The main requirement for a project is to be design-oriented, well-defined, and achievable within an academic year. The importance of the design requirement needs to be stressed since this comes directly from the organization that accredits the Bioe program. Although pure hypothesis driven research does not qualify as design, it may be possible to cast a more traditional research project in design terms. Projects in which students serve as technicians or simply realize a recipe for a solution are not appropriate.'
b'If you would like to propose a project, please email Terry Layton tnl@uic.edu and include a Project Title, Sponsor Info, and complete description.'
b'2) RESEARCH & DEVELOP YOUR PROJECT'
b'There are many resources available, to develop a prototype or proof of concept, through your project\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor and Bioe department. Your team will be responsible to research your idea, manage your time, utilize available resources, and bring your project into a presentable concept.\xc2\xa0Materials can be purchased online or at a local hardware store. (Note: See Budget &\xc2\xa0Purchasing Supplies\xc2\xa0section below for info on how to process your reimbursements. For ONLINE purchases, please use links below, build your cart and email to bioepay@uic.edu) '
