b'This is the home page for LUG at UIC. LUG stands for Linux Users Group, this means that we focus on learning all things \n\t\t\t\t\trelated to Linux. Linux is an open source operating system that uses the Linux kernel. Because of its open nature Linux and the Linux kernel can be modified to suit a particular purpose. Thanks to this you can find Linux in many places such as your phone, a car, and even the United States Postal Service use Linux. \n\t\t\t\t\tWant to know more?
