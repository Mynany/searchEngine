b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing Dale Reed never does in class, it\xe2\x80\x99s ask the tired question that can make lecture halls go silent: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes anyone have any questions?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I do say is, \xe2\x80\x98Talk to your partner,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Reed, clinical professor in computer science.'
b'If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep people engaged, his other go-to methods do \xe2\x80\x94 like surprise money for in-class participation, repetitions of programming functions in chipmunk voices and problem-solving opportunities.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9c[Students] never know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reed, smiling.'
b'But his spontaneity shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be confused with randomness.'
b'The 20-year teaching veteran\xe2\x80\x99s interactive and inquiry-based teaching strategies are carefully put together to inspire permanent, powerful learning experiences.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody in the room is talking to each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Reed said, describing a typical class, \xe2\x80\x9cfuriously trying to engage, understand a question, grappling with it, guessing right or wrong. Their brain is very active. So when the answer comes, it makes their brain sticky. They\xe2\x80\x99ll remember.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'His planning and style have earned him 4.2 and 4.5 ratings for course quality and teaching evaluations from his department, where the average is 3.5. During his time at UIC, Reed has won the Faculty Teaching, Teaching Recognition Program, INSPIRE and Silver Circle awards, and more.'
b'The recognition is proof of what Reed describes as a lifelong, informal crusade. His mission is to become a better teacher \xe2\x80\x94 and change the lives of students. That\xe2\x80\x99s what first inspired him to do postdoctoral work at Northwestern University, where he earned a master\xe2\x80\x99s and Ph.D. in computer science.'
b'Reed also works with high school teachers and has cofounded the Chicago chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association, creating introductory coding classes for high schools. He was part of a committee that designed an Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles curriculum and exam.'
b'At UIC, he developed a similar version of the class and later revamped the department\xe2\x80\x99s Computer Ethics and Technical Communications course.'
b'Reed has worked to increase UIC CS enrollment, giving presentations to about 10,000 high school students and growing the department from 185 students in 2005 to more than 1,060 in 2017.'
b'He is focused on helping UIC students graduate. In the past, he\xe2\x80\x99s secured approximately $600,000 in NSF scholarship funding for computer science students; some work for industry leaders like Google now.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very successful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reed, expressing his gratitude for the amount of support he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten from the department and college.'
b'But the real driving force behind each one of his efforts is that he\xe2\x80\x99s passionate about what he does.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you love your students and you want what\xe2\x80\x99s best for them, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be motivated to go the extra mile,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
