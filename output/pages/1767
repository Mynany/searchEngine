b'Science Learning Center'
b'\n        The Science Learning Center (SLC, room 201 in the Science\n        and Engineering South building, SES) is a place in which\n        all levels of expertise meet and exchange ideas. It is home\n        to the sciences: biology, chemistry, earth and\n        environmental science and physics. Students can obtain\n        tutoring in many of the 100-level science courses from\n        graduate teaching assistants who keep regular office hours\n        each week as well as from student tutors who have recently\n        excelled in those classes. Students may also find their\n        teacher in the Center as many of them use the open,\n        friendly spaces available in the center for their office\n        hours. The Center is a great place to meet friends to go\n        over homework problems and to study for exams. The Science\n        Learning Center also contains computers for general use as\n        well as a formal computer lab that is overseen by the\n        Academic Computing and Communications Center (ACCC), and an\n        ACCC consultant is available to assist computer users at\n        all times. In addition, inside the Science Learning Center\n        is a UIC office of WISE, the Women in Science and\n        Engineering Program..\n        '
b'Dr. Clark and the staff at the SLC are committed to providing a welcoming environment to all students.  In accordance with the University of Illinois non-discrimination  policy, we are committed to the most fundamental principles of academic  freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity.   All decisions are based on individual merit and are free from invidious discrimination in all its forms.  We will not engage in discrimination or harassment against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran and will comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders and regulations.  Dr. Clark is a participant in the Safe Zone program at UIC that creates and supports allies for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning communities.\n\n        The Science Learning Center is also home to peer-led study\n        groups that focus on the sciences. Student-leaders, who are\n        trained in group dynamics and problem solving techniques,\n        have expertise in a particular subject area. Generally the\n        peer-leaders are members of the UIC Honor\xe2\x80\x99s College who\n        have successfully completed these courses. Peer-leaders\n        guide their students toward development of sound study\n        skills by encouraging them to work together to solve\n        problems. In this manner students contribute to the\n        solution of a problem even as they learn techniques and\n        skills from their peers. The goal of the peer-led study\n        groups is to assist students to develop individual study\n        strategies tailored to the demands of a specific\n        discipline.\n        \n\nHOURS:\n            8 AM - 6:30 PM, Monday through Thursday, 8 AM- 5 PM Friday.    \n        The SLC is closed evenings, weekends and school holidays.\n        \n\n        TA office hours and professor office hours are scheduled at\n        the start of each semester, although a request to reserve a\n        time in one of the study areas may be made at any time\n        during the semester for open times/rooms. The SLC may also\n        be used for departmental activities such as holiday\n        parties. All queries regarding the use of the SLC should be\n        directed to Dr. Clark (see bottom of page for an email\n        link) except for queries regarding scheduling of the\n        computer lab inside the SLC - these should be directed to\n        the ACCC.\n\n'
