b'Industrial engineering is concerned with the analysis, design, improvement, and installation of integrated systems of people, material, information, equipment, and energy. Industrial Engineering is where engineering meets business. Industrial engineers are specially trained to eliminate practices that waste time, money, energy and other resources. Graduates in industrial engineering can work in almost any industry, including manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, transportation, finance, electronics, entertainment and many others.'
