b'Make sure that you complete the text box, if degree information needs to be changed.'
b'The Intent to Graduate must be submitted for the term you intend to graduate.\xc2\xa0 The online form is available\xc2\xa0from the time\xc2\xa0when registration for that term begins through the Friday of the third week of fall and spring semesters, or through the second week of the summer (eight-week) session.\xc2\xa0 If you complete an\xc2\xa0Intent to Graduate for one term and do not graduate that term, you must complete another Intent to Graduate for the new term\xc2\xa0in which you are attempting to graduate.\xc2\xa0'
b'If you are declaring for a master or doctoral degree, your college is "Graduate College," except for:'
b'Confirmation of Submission'
b'Once you submit the Intent to Graduate a confirmation will appear on the screen, which you may print.\xc2\xa0 You need to wait for that confirmation to appear before leaving the browser, as that is the only notice you receive of successful submission.\xc2\xa0 If you submit an Intent to Graduate successfully and you later try to submit another one for the same term, the system will not allow you to do so.'
b'Verifying Submission Later'
b'If you are unsure whether or not you correctly submitted an Intent to Graduate, go to https://my.uic.edu and login.\xc2\xa0 Click on the "Student" tab, and choose the "Student Self Service" portlet.

b'Click here for a list of approved concentrations by program'
b'Diploma and Diploma Mailing Address'
b'The Diploma is a recognition of completion of your degree, although the offical document attesting to completion of a degree is the transcript.\xc2\xa0 Diplomas are mailed to graduates approximately one month after the term of graduation.\xc2\xa0 Diplomas are mailed after Fall, Spring and Summer terms and are not distributed at the Fall and Spring term commencement ceremonies.\xc2\xa0'
b'Diplomas are\xc2\xa0sent to the Diploma Mailing address in the student database.\xc2\xa0 Students may change the mailing address as needed using the procedures detailed in the Intent to Graduate.\xc2\xa0 Alternatively, students may enter a Diploma Mailing Address in Student Self-Service up until one week after final exams end.\xc2\xa0 If the Diploma Mailing Address needs to be added or changed after that time, the student must contact the Office of Registration and Records (Records) in the Office of Admissions and Records.\xc2\xa0 Also, if the diploma is not received after three months, or there are questions about the diploma, the Office of Registration and Records (Records) should be consulted.\xc2\xa0'

b'Date of Graduation\xc2\xa0'
b'The University of Illinois at Chicago establishes an official date of conferral of degrees for every term (Fall, Spring and Summer).\xc2\xa0 Although degree requirements, including, for example, defense of thesis, may have been completed earlier in the term, the official date of graduation is what is printed on the student transcript. \xc2\xa0'
b'The date all requirements have been completed may be needed\xc2\xa0to qualify for a job, other appointment, or\xc2\xa0for Practical Training (international students).\xc2\xa0 However, the official graduation date is the date of degree conferral. Also, the official conferral date of a degree may or may not correspond with the date of your commencement ceremony.'
