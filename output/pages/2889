b'Curriculum Overview'
b'In the first year of the program, students will take compulsory subjects such as protein biochemistry, cell biology, immunology, bioethics, statistics, product development, and a series of elective subjects. This coursework is designed to enhance their theoretical and practical training in a selection of techniques and processes common to biotechnology research. The second year will vary depending on the track chosen. The MBT program curriculum is designed with flexibility to allow schedule tailoring the need of a wide range of students. Students will be guided to plan the route they wish to take to fit their needs throughout the program. Graduate Catalog: https://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/colleges-schools/medicine/mbt/#coursestext'
