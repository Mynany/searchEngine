b'Ways to Give'
b'It is important to be able to personalize your giving. Every gift is important and used in the way the donor directs. Each gift helps the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria advance its mission to \xe2\x80\x9cLead Collaboration to Improve health.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Some donors have particular financial planning needs. They wish to be able to donate stock or other assets. Others are interested in estate planning and wish advice on how this can be accomplished. We will be delighted to connect you to individuals at the University of Illinois Foundation who can offer advice on how the giving process can be tailored to your needs.'
b'Some of you may wish to create an endowment. Endowments are gifts where the current value of the gift is held in perpetuity. The annual interest on the gift is used to support the area of your choice. Endowments are very critical to UICOMP\xe2\x80\x99s long term development, providing continual support for our educational, research and patient care mission. Please contact UICOMP\xe2\x80\x99s advancement office at 309-671-8481 if you are interested in endowments. A minimum total gift of $25,000 is required to start an endowment. Larger gifts can be recognized with named lectures, professorships or chairs.'
