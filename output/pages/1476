b'Home'
b'Bioengineering majors interested in industry, academia or professional school should consider a Master\xe2\x80\x99s degree. The accelerated BS/MS track is essentially a program to make the most of existing opportunities in the Bioengineering department.*\r\n\r\nThis accelerated track benefits UIC Bioengineering undergraduate students. The time to the MS degree can be significantly shortened, often to only two semesters beyond completion of the BS.'
b'THE GENERAL PLAN'
b'The first step is to begin the MS thesis research while completing the BS. This synergy is possible, especially with regards to BIOE 398 \xe2\x80\x93 Undergraduate Research, BIOE 396/397 \xe2\x80\x93 Senior Design I & II, or internship activities.\r\n\r\nWith senior activities aligned towards research, the Master\xe2\x80\x99s thesis can progress rapidly, and can often be completed within one year.\r\n\r\nThe MS in Bioengineering requires 28 credit hours of course work, of which 12 hours must be at the 500-level.\r\n\r\nBS/MS students are encouraged to take up to 9 hours of graduate-level courses (400- and 500-level) in addition to their BS requirements.\r\n\r\nThese 9 hours will transfer toward the MS degree requirements, leaving 19 credit hours (about 5 courses) to be taken while enrolled in the MS program. These remaining courses can be completed in one year.'
b'WHEN TO APPLY'
b'Students should follow the standard application procedures for the MS in Bioengineering (see Application Deadlines below). Interested students should discuss the opportunities for MS thesis research with the undergraduate research sponsor as early as possible.'
