b'The ECE faculty in the nanotechnology and related areas have active collaborations with\xc2\xa0researchers at Argonne National Lab (ANL). ANL has also periodically given internships to ECE\xc2\xa0Ph.D. students. Two examples of collaborations between ECE and ANL are those involving Prof.\xc2\xa0Methlushko\xe2\x80\x99s and Paprotny\xe2\x80\x99s research.'
b'Prof. Metlushko\xe2\x80\x99s research in nano-science and engineering is inherently interdisciplinary.\xc2\xa0Without any doubt one could say that Prof. Metlushko\xe2\x80\x99s work at ANL would not have been\xc2\xa0possible without the excellent assistance of his colleagues there: (a) G.Crabtree, M.Grimsditch,\xc2\xa0G.P.Felcher,\xc2\xa0 D.J.Hinks, M.Kirk, V W. Kwok. Dongqi Li, V. Novosad, L.Rehn, U.Welp and\xc2\xa0N.Zaluzec, at the Materials Science Division, ANL. (b) V. Rose and S.D.Bader at Argonne\xc2\xa0NanoCenter . (c) G. Srajer, Y. Choi , D. R. Lee and J. W. Freeland at Advanced Photon Source,\xc2\xa0ANL. The results of this UIC/ANL collaboration were published in more than 30 articles.'
b'Prof. Paprotny has collaboratde with ANL researchers Ralu Divan, Liliana Stan, and Leo Occola\xc2\xa0on developing nanomaterials for new experimental sensors, as well as novel mobile and flying\xc2\xa0microrobotic platforms.'
