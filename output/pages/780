b'IDEA (Information Data Expertise Access) Commons is a special place, conceived in 2006 and realized in Fall 2011.\xc2\xa0 Located at the south end of the first floor of the Richard J. Daley Library, the IDEA Commons is designed to help students use technology and library research materials to complete their academic work.\xc2\xa0 There are areas for research, presentations, group study, tutoring, reference consultations, and socializing.\xc2\xa0 By integrating information resources, technology and expertise, the IDEA Commons will maximize the learning and social environment for UIC students. The Library and ACCC are partners in providing these services and opportunities to students.\xc2\xa0 Note the 24 hour availability of this space in the Schedule.\xc2\xa0'
