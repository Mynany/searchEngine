We take seriously our public mission and land-grant commitment to not only expand educational pathways for undocumented students, but\xc2\xa0also to ensure that they have high-quality educational experiences.\xc2\xa0The Office of Diversity promotes greater awareness and understanding of undocumented students\xe2\x80\x99 experiences (while maintaining the confidentiality of individuals) and develops campus responses and processes to address their needs related to academic success.'
b'Office of Diversity Offers a Range of Resources and Services to Help Undocumented Students'
b'For students who are undocumented or from mixed immigration status families, we have a range of resources and services to help. For instance, UIC Dream provides information to current and prospective students and their families regarding residency for in-state tuition and enrollment.'
