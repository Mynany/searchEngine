b'Ignite is an eight-week program that supports first- and second-year undergraduate students as they begin to navigate and explore the concepts of leadership and self-reflection. Meeting once a week with peer facilitators and mentors, Ignite participants gain access to valuable campus resources, along with gaining insight into the values, support, and competencies needed for positive involvement at UIC. Using a passion-driven action plan, students distinguish key identities, values, and issues that matter to them. Upon completion of the program, students will feel better connected with the UIC community, feel more in touch with their personal goals, and become a change agent for the future.'
