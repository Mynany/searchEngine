b'The master of city design degree, based in the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, will offer an interdisciplinary learning experience that blends elements of architecture, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning and other creative fields. Students will experience intensive city-based courses and studios that provide immersive exposure to integrated design and contemporary professional practice.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe master of city design expands the portfolio of degree offerings by the college, reflecting the changing needs of cities and metropolitan regions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Pagano, dean of the college. \xe2\x80\x9cThat the degree is offered in the center of a global city makes it an exceptionally attractive program for professionals who are looking to enhance their skill set.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Serving as director designate for the program is Sanjeev Vidyarthi, whose own training and professional experience combines architecture, urban design and spatial planning.'

b'Sanjeev Vidyarthi, UIC associate professor of urban planning and policy and director designate of the master of city design program.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe master of city design program not only showcases the university\xe2\x80\x99s Great Cities Commitment, but is also well-positioned to produce reflective designers equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and skills to face the complex challenges of an increasingly urban world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vidyarthi, associate professor of urban planning and policy.'
b'The program will prepare students for career opportunities at planning and design consulting firms and related work with governments, foundations, community organizations and public sector agencies. It will also enable them to gain acceptance to doctoral programs in urban planning and design.'
b'Graduates of the program will be desirable to prospective employers for their \xe2\x80\x9cability to conceive urban public spaces and civic improvement projects by focusing on the physical design aspects of spatial relationships and interactions between people and places,\xe2\x80\x9d Vidyarthi said.'
b'The program\xe2\x80\x99s courses will be taught by faculty and urban scholars from UIC research centers such as the Great Cities Institute and Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement, and accomplished practitioners from Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s leading design firms.'
b'The 38-credit-hour degree can be completed in one year of full-time study. Applications are due Feb. 15 for international applicants and March 15 for domestic applicants. To be considered for a limited number of departmental scholarships, applicants should apply by Jan. 15.'
