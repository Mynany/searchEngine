b'Dear Research Community,'
b'The Effort Reporting System (ERS) is now open and ready for AY18 certifications to be completed. Effort is the time spent on all university activities. The ERS is designed to document effort actually expended by individuals on each sponsored award during AY18 (8/16/17 \xe2\x80\x93 8/15/18) and reconcile effort committed in award document(s).\xc2\xa0 This effort can be paid directly by the award and/or other funding sources (i.e. cost shared) to ensure effort commitments are met.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you go through the world thinking that you only have a hammer, the only thing you can do is hammer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawless, professor of educational psychology. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you go through life with a complement of tools and you are able to fluidly mix and match those tools to the job that\xe2\x80\x99s in front of you, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to better accomplish the job.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'For more than 10 years, Dima Qato worked as a retail pharmacist and witnessed countless examples of the vital role pharmacies play in the public health system, particularly when it comes to access to and safe use of medications.'
b'However, while many like Qato consider pharmacies to be an essential part of our health care system, the independent and chain retailers are not regulated by or held accountable to any of the groups that provide checks and balances for other essential health services, like care in hospitals and clinics.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the aspects I work on is heterogeneous data \xe2\x80\x94 for example, how to make sense of data that is collected with different spatial and temporal granularities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cruz, professor of computer science.'
b'The U.S. Census, for example, collects data every 10 years, but other population data within a city may be taken every month or year.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo if you want to tell the story of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in a city, you cannot put apples and oranges together,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'

b'Richard Novak has been working to identify therapies and vaccines for HIV since the 1980s, when the infection first started making the news as it spread among the gay community.'
b'Novak was a young assistant professor of infectious disease at UIC when he pushed for the hospital to open a dedicated HIV clinic because the general infectious disease department wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to handle the influx of HIV patients.
