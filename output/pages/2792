b'Career Planning and Residency Matching Support'
b'Choosing a specialty is a longitudinal process woven throughout medical school.'
b'Students should be organized and methodical in their approach to residency selection, but the student who is undecided is not alone. Many sources of information and assistance are available: advisors, department chairs, faculty, residents, senior students who have completed their application process and former students.'
b'The\xc2\xa0University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford provides robust, longitudinal career development programming presented informally and formally through the Road to Residency Program.'
b'Road to Residency'
b'Road to Residency is an Office of Student Affairs program that helps medical students prepare for the next step in their educational journey: matching into a residency program following medical school graduation. Through workshops, field trips and special events, Road to Residency helps students navigate medical school, explore specialties and prepare for residency applications and interviews.'
b'Blackboard Resources'
b'The UICOMR Blackboard site provides a wealth of information and links to guide the student through the process. The site is located within the Clerkship & Course Coordination \xe2\x80\x9ccourse\xe2\x80\x9d and is accessed by clicking on the \xe2\x80\x9cCareer Planning\xe2\x80\x9d button on the left side of the screen.'
b'Careers in Medicine Resources'
b'Students are encouraged to take advantage of online\xc2\xa0Careers in Medicine (CiM) self-assessments and resources. CiM is designed to help students make an informed decision about specialty and to provide guidelines for future career choices. The student\xe2\x80\x99s AAMC/AMCAS identification number is used to access CiM.'

b'Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE)'
b'Medical Student Performance Evaluations (informally known as the Dean\xe2\x80\x99s Letter) are written in summer and early fall of the student\xe2\x80\x99s M4 year. Beginning in the summer of the M4 year, students make consultation appointments with the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs to help with development of the MSPE. The MSPE is a permanent record of the student\xe2\x80\x99s medical education. As such, it includes:'
