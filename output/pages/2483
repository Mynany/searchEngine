b'Tumblr is so easy to use that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to explain.'
b'We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put whatever they want on it. Stories, photos, GIFs, TV shows, links, quips, dumb jokes, smart jokes, Spotify tracks, mp3s, videos, fashion, art, deep stuff. Tumblr is 451 million different blogs, filled with literally whatever.'
b'Tumblr is blogs.'
b'Turns out that when you make it easy to create interesting things, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what people do. All those great, random blogs your friends send you, those are Tumblr blogs. We\xe2\x80\x99ll help you find and follow blogs like that, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll help other people find and follow yours.'
b'You already know how this works.'
b'Once you follow a blog, all of its posts show up in your dashboard, just like you\xe2\x80\x99d expect. See something great? Reblog it to your own blog. Add commentary if you like. Make it your own. Other people will do the same to your posts. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you meet people here.'
b'Seriously, put anything you want here.'
b'Seven post types to get you started. Your brain can do the rest. This thing is yours. Use it however you like.'
