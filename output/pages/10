b' CS Minor'
b'Home'
b'The Computer Science (CS) minor is a great way to broaden your horizons to gain a deeper understanding of computing technology.\xc2\xa0 It is also an excellent way to enhance your qualifications in an increasingly interdisciplinary world in which computing plays a central role.'
b'With a CS minor on your resume, you will be able to market yourself as a well rounded individual who can grasp both technical and theoretical concepts.\xc2\xa0 The elective choices are very diverse, including Game Design, Database Systems, Software Design, Visualization, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Hardware Organization and Graphics.'
b'Minor in Computer Science'
b'The first step is to take and complete an introductory programming course: CS 107, CS 109 or CS 111.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0'
b'Next, fill out an application in the College of Engineering office (SEO 123) to officially request the CS minor. Minimum requirements: 2.0/4.0 GPA for College of Engineering (COE) students; 2.5/4.0 for non COE students.'
b'The Computer Science minor is available to current undergraduate students at UIC and requires 15-17 semester hours excluding prerequisite courses.\xc2\xa0 CS minor is not available to majors in either Computer Engineering or Mathematical Computer Science.'
b'Prerequisite Courses'
b'Requirements (Total 15-17 hrs)'
b'*A student may substitute CS 107 for both CS 111 and CS 141, thus reducing the number of hours for the CS mior by 2 credit hours. This substitution was designed for students in the College of Engineering.'
b'CS Minor Application'
b'To apply for the CS Minor fill out the application in the College of Engineering (SEO 123).'
