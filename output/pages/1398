b'Registration is open for UIC\xe2\x80\x99s annual Lunch with an\xc2\xa0Industrial Engineer\xc2\xa0open house. Hosted by the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (MIE) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the event is set for Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Engineering Research Facility (ERF), 842 W. Taylor St., Chicago.'
b'The free event is for area high school students and their parents/guardians to learn about our department\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Engineering degree program, and the wide-range of careers open to graduates. The lunch will include an interactive information session, lab tours, and hands-on engineering challenges to learn how industrial engineers work in the real world. At the end of this exciting program, we will serve lunch and invite our faculty and student ambassadors to sit down with participants to answer questions about industrial engineering and UIC.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are looking for students who are inquisitive and curious about the world around them, to discover the imaginative aspects of engineering,\xe2\x80\x9d said Quintin Williams, a clinical assistant professor\xc2\xa0in MIE. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an opportunity for students that have an interest in various fields associated with business, science, technology, and engineering. It\xe2\x80\x99s for those who want to try new things and use their heads and hands to solve problems.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0'
b'Industrial engineering is the business side of engineering. This major is essential to the progress and success of business and industry solutions of today. Industrial engineering serves as a career track that infuses business, engineering, management, and human services together to meet the optimal goal of a company\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line.'
b'Industrial Engineering focuses on the design, improvement, and installation of integrated systems of people, material, and equipment. UIC\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial engineering program gives knowledge of principles and methods in engineering design, physical sciences, and social sciences. This knowledge is used to specify, predict, and evaluate systems. By collecting, analyzing, and arranging such knowledge, industrial engineers enable management to utilize resources effectively and efficiently. In order to design and operate complex systems, the industrial engineer must acquire comprehensive knowledge in the following areas: manufacturing engineering; production engineering; systems engineering; human factors/ergonomics; maintenance; and safety engineering.'
b'Registration is open until Nov. 16, 2018, or until maximum capacity is reached. To register or learn more about the event, visit\xc2\xa0http://mie.uic.edu/lunch-with-an-industrial-engineer.'
