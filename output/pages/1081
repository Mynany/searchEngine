b'Roland MDX-40A CNC Mill'
b'This is a 4 axis CNC mill capable of doing both indexed and continuous rotation paths. It\xe2\x80\x99s primary intention is for prototyping so it\xe2\x80\x99s designed around cutting foams, plastic, wax, and other softer milling materials.'
b'We have several options for software depending on the type of object being cut. Because of the 4th axis this is a more complicated setup than the Othermill.'
b'In general we will help you generate toolpaths and set the machine up. Bring all source files. We can work with both STL and CAD files.\xc2\xa0 '
b'Emergency Stop (E-Stop):\n'
b'Large red button on the front of the machine. Do not rely on the \xe2\x80\x9cStop Cutting\xe2\x80\x9d button through software controls. Always err on the side of saving a tool.\n\n'
b'Materials supported\n(this list will expand as we work with more materials \xe2\x80\x93 contact us with questions):'
b'Software:'
b'Pausing during cutting:'
b'Pressing the \xe2\x80\x9cView\xe2\x80\x9d button on the front of the machine will cause the tool to lift, stop, and will move the model forward. Wait until the movement is complete before opening the cover. From here you can clear chips during a job.'
b'To resume close the cover and hold \xe2\x80\x9cView\xe2\x80\x9d until the part moves back to the cutting area.'
b'Running a job:'
b'The general steps are as follows:'
b'The mill needs to be watched fairly actively while cutting. Especially during critical parts of cutting.'
b'Save operations for different tools as different files. Be very mindful of how you have chaining setup. Despite what the mill says it MAY NOT PAUSE when it needs a new tool. It depends on your gcode.'
b'Rotary milling:'
b'For indexed milling it is critically important that you move the stock in Y BEFORE ROTATING. In DeskProto this is not done automatically and is done in the advanced settings for a particular operation. It needs to be done on EACH operation and affects how your chaining is set up. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t the stock will just turn in place and will snap a tool.'
b'For full rotary a cylindrical workpiece is assumed in DeskProto. If using square stock simply use the diagonal of the square as the diameter of a cylinder. Your roughing operation will have some air milling but that\xe2\x80\x99s really not a problem.'
b'Cleaning the machine:'
b'Use the shop vac to remove dust from cutting after every job. Make sure to vacuum all areas, taking great care around the tool.'
b'Changing tools:'
b'Wrenches are kept on the left side of the machine. Do not allow the tool to fall \xe2\x80\x93 use a towel to catch it if necessary.'
b'The locating cycle for the Z axis needs to be performed after each change. Use the wizard in VPanel.'
b'We have both 1/8\xe2\x80\xb3 and 1/4\xe2\x80\xb3 shank tools, be sure to use the correct one.'
