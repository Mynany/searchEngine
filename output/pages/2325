b'Innovators of ECE: On April 30th, Innovate@UIC celebrated the 2013 Innovator and Inventor of the Year Awards.'
b'The celebration honored remarkable innovators and inventors alike at University of Illinois at Chicago whose efforts contributed to significantly advancing his or her invention towards commercialization and contributed to the development of intellectual property at UIC, which has the potential to make a significant impact. These awards recognize creativity and outstanding commitment either through participation in the licensing process, through entrepreneurial efforts or in commitment as demonstrated throughout the invention process.'
b'It is with great honor and pleasure that Innovate@UIC and the Office of Technology Management announce that Dr. Alan Feinerman has been named the 2013 UIC Innovator of the Year and Dr. Sudip Mazumder the 2013 UIC Inventor of the Year. Innovate@UIC and the OTM would like to offer congratulations to this year\xe2\x80\x99s Innovator and Inventor of the year award recipients. We would also like to offer our profound thanks to all those who submitted nominations. There was a remarkable collection of nominees for this year\xe2\x80\x99s awards. The transformative and inspiring ideas represented in the nominations remind us of the outstanding innovation occurring on the UIC campus.'

b'About the Winners'
b'Dr. Alan Feinerman, Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), earned his Ph.D. in physics from Northwestern University. Dr. Feinerman\xe2\x80\x99s research interests are the development of ultra low thermal conductivity insulation, microfluidics for laboratory on a chip and drug delivery, distributed physical vapor deposition of alloys and compounds, and granular physics.'
b'Dr. Feinerman founded Thermal Conservation Technologies (TCT), a UIC startup venture focused on energy preservation and sustainability through the utilization of high-performance vacuum insulation. TCT was awarded the 2011 Clean Energy Challenge Competition which seeks to identify clean energy businesses in the Midwest with the potential to bring novel innovations to the marketplace.Dr. Feinerman was previously named the 2011 UIC Inventor of the year.'
b'Dr. Sudip Mazumder, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UIC, earned his Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Dr. Mazumder\xe2\x80\x99s current areas of interests are interactive power-electronics/power networks, smart grid, and energy storage; renewable and alternative energy based power electronics systems for distributed generation and microgrid; and optically-triggered wide-bandgap power-electronics device and control technologies, and SiC and GaN\xc2\xa0device based high-frequency, high-temperature, and high-voltage power electronics.'
b'His inventions will bring about substantial reductions in the weight, size, and cost in power-electronic systems for smart grid, renewable energy, and electric vehicles, as well as enhancements in their efficiency and reliability.'
