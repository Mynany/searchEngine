b'\xe2\x80\x9cInteracting with Information through Visualization\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Abstract:'
b'The catch phrase these days is \xe2\x80\x98big data\xe2\x80\x99 and this phrase is often accompanied by the assumption that it is matched with big industry and big science. However, as individuals, we are becoming more aware that data is also impinging on our personal lives. Since my overarching research goal is to create interactive visualizations that support us in our everyday practices both at work and at play, I am interested in this impact. In this talk, I will discuss how the currently shifting information climate is opening up new research opportunities, notably in personal visualization and visualization literacy. I will discuss the interplay between small data and big data considering the potential of visualization for empowering ourselves in our everyday lives.'
b'Biography:'
b'Sheelagh Carpendale is a professor at the University of Calgary where she holds a Canada Research Chair in Information Visualization and the NSERC/AITF/SMART Industrial Research Chair in Interactive Technologies. She is the recipient of many awards including the NSERC Steacie and a BAFTA (British equivalent to an Oscar). Her research draws upon her combined backgrounds in computer science and visual arts, benefiting from the interdisciplinary cross-fertilization to enable the design of innovative, people-centered information technologies. By studying how people interact with information both in work and social practices, she works towards designing more natural, accessible and understandable interactive visual representations of data. She combines information visualization, visual analytics and human-computer interaction with innovative new interaction techniques to better support the everyday practices of people who are viewing, representing, and interacting with information.'
