b"In today's world, no matter which field we belong to, innovation by incorporating technology is the key to succeed and propel forward. Likewise, UIC's MSF program has followed a similar approach in developing an innovative curriculum!\xc2\xa0The MSF program at UIC is an enriching experience.\xc2\xa0The great part is that it's a STEM program where most of the courses are quantitative and analytics driven. The coursework is designed in such a way that there is a good blend of conceptual and practical learning. This includes usage of state of the art tools which are currently employed in the industry. I would highly recommend this program to any individual focussing to build a career in Fin/FinTech domains."
