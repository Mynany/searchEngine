b'UIC LED AIR-MICROFLUIDICS GROUP CREATES WEARABLE, MOBILE SENSORS TO MEASURE AIR QUALITY'
b'Dr. Igor Paprotny wants to change the air quality in Chicago. To accomplish this task, he is planning to use the city as his laboratory and gather data with the help of residents as \xe2\x80\x9ccitizen scientists.\xe2\x80\x9d Paprotny, an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), is leading the Air-Microfluidics Group (AMFG), which is a research consortium that includes UIC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, and a researcher from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The team, which includes UIC students Omid Mahdavipour, Dorsa Fahimi, and John Sabino, is developing the direct-read mass MEMS PM2.5 sensor which is a potentially wearable particulate matter sensor about the size of a memory stick that could be connected to a cell phone, and provide your exposure in real time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is much smaller than the instrumentation currently used by the EPA to measure air pollution, which is about the size of a toaster or a desktop computer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paprotny. \xe2\x80\x9cSince our sensor measures the mass of the particulates it has the potential to be very accurate, perhaps approaching EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Reference Method (FRM) for PM2.5, which is currently used as the gold standard for measuring PM2.5 concentration.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Particulate matter, which is also known as \xe2\x80\x9cparticle pollution\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPM,\xe2\x80\x9d is a mixture of tiny particles and liquid droplets. Particle pollution consists of a number of components, including acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. According to the EPA, \xe2\x80\x9cthe size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. The EPA is concerned about particles that are 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller because those are the particles that generally pass through the throat and nose and enter the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'There is particulate matter that is 10 microns or smaller called PM10, and the even smaller one is called PM2.5, which is particulates that are 2.5 microns or smaller. A micron is 1000th of a millimeter.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen particles get small, such as below 2.5 microns, they are even more dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paprotny. \xe2\x80\x9cThe get very deep into our lungs, and we really don\xe2\x80\x99t have a natural way to get rid of them. Our immune system cannot handle them because they are too big, but they are still small enough to enter deep into our respiratory system.\xe2\x80\x9d That is why PM2.5 is bad. Since EPA started regulating PM2.5 exposure in the 80s, the exposure limit has been revised several times as we learned how bad fine particles really are.'
b'According to Paprotny, other low-cost sensors are not very accurate in detecting particulate matter. These sensors use an optical method, and often miscalculate their actual concentration. Other precise, mass-based (not-optical based) sensors are much more expensive \xe2\x80\x93 as much as $10,000 to $50,000.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat this means is that we need a more accurate low-cost sensor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paprotny. \xe2\x80\x9cOur sensor is currently the only sensor that actually weighs the particles and reports the concentration as a mass. We have a resonator that weighs the particles, and we pull in the air and it goes through the channels and the first thing we do is separate the bigger particles from the smaller ones \xe2\x80\x93 which means it gives us PM2.5. It\xe2\x80\x99s currently the only technology that fits in a wearable or portable device and is capable of measuring precisely what the EPA is concerned about.\xe2\x80\x9d Using the \xe2\x80\x9cDirect-Read Mass MEMS PM2.5 Sensor,\xe2\x80\x9d Paprotny wants to study the air quality throughout Chicago. Due to the sensor\xe2\x80\x99s small size, it will cost approximately $20 in large quantities to fabricate, while being much more accurate than other low-cost PM2.5 sensors.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in discussions to potentially work with a Chicago environmental organization to recruit \xe2\x80\x9ccitizen scientists\xe2\x80\x9d to wear the sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paprotny. \xe2\x80\x9cWith mobile sensors across the city, we can build a map of pollution and gather data. This sensor has the potential to make Chicago a healthier city, which has big issues with air pollution and asthma. We are also starting collaboration with the School of Public Health at UIC to investigate the connection between PM exposure and health effects.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Data from the Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago shows that \xe2\x80\x9cin Cook County, 317,906 adults and 121,610 children have been diagnosed with asthma,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe asthma hospitalization rate in Chicago is nearly double the national average.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur research could help determine quickly if the local air-pollution could cause or promote respiratory problems such as asthma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paprotny. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could help us target problem areas and implement solutions to combat the pollution in those areas. It could also, for the first time really, provide a precise measurement of personalized PM2.5 exposure in real time. A portable PM sensor attached to a cell-phone could enable all of us to scan the air around us, and determine if it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to go out. This could be especially relevant with all the recent bad air-pollution in Asia. We expect air around us to be clean, and it is not always the case.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cInhalable coarse particles,\xe2\x80\x9d such as those found near roadways and dusty industries, are larger than 2.5 micrometers and smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFine particles,\xe2\x80\x9d such as those found in smoke and haze, are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller. These particles can be directly emitted from sources such as forest fires, or they can form when gases emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles react in the air.'
