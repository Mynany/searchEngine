b'\n        Student Testimonials\n      '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe most important take away for me was seeing the work my mentor does and listening to the work he has done, which is quite valuable. School on its own would not have shown me what project management or design build could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ~Kitty, Senior, Civil Eng. (Featured in the photo with her mentor)\n'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy mentor has given a lot of insight in all the questions I have been asking. We mostly talk about school stuff and research.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ~Danilo, Senior, Computer Eng.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy mentor has been great. We had phone conversations once every couple of weeks. He has given me excellent advice regarding school, projects, and finding a job. I even got a tour of his work place and what they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ~Xiong, Senior, Electrical Eng.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI received a plethora of advice regarding the real world and the experiences encountered by my mentor that has, quite honestly, helped me immensely.\xc2\xa0His experience regarding graduate school helped me to open my eyes at the possibility of going myself. I am immensely fortunate to have spoken to such a humble and wise individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ~Brandon, Senior, Mechanical Eng.'

b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t sell yourself short when it comes to the power and value of mentorship: What may be obvious or second nature to you after years of experience may be transformational to someone who is just beginning their journey.'
