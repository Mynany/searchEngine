b'The SGA serves as an umbrella organization to student committee representatives and to the Student Interest Groups. Students in Peoria elect representatives from their classes to the SGA, the University Medical Student Council (UMSC), and to seven site committees. Other site committees recruit student membership through volunteerism or appointment by the SGA. Selection of student representatives to college-level committees is handled by the UMSC.'
b'The SGA sponsors programs and activities of interest to students. Typical projects include speaker nights on a variety of topics, social and recreational events, blood drives, recycling programs, \xe2\x80\x9cDialogue with the Dean,\xe2\x80\x9d Senior Week, USMLE prep advice, and more.'
b'Students are urged to become involved in the COM by participating in leadership opportunities and communicating their concerns to their elected representatives.'
