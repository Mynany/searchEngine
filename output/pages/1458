b'The longevity of electronic devices is tested in many ways as they endure the rigors of daily usage. Even when they are treated with the utmost care, they still have a major challenge to overcome \xe2\x80\x93 the removal of heat.'
b'To alleviate this problem, ECE Assistant Professor Junxia \xe2\x80\x9cLucy\xe2\x80\x9d Shi and her team of researchers in the Advanced Semiconductor Materials and Devices Laboratory at UIC are focusing on using a novel method for cooling hotspots in electronics and capturing the wasted heat to use to power the devices. The new technique additionally has the potential to expand the longevity of electronic components.'
b'The results of their research were recently published in the prestigious journals Scientific Reports and Physical Review Materials.'

b'Electronic devices are getting miniaturized, and produce a lot of heat when they carry currents. If the heat is not extracted out of the device, it will reduce the operating lifetime. Present cooling techniques are only efficient when the heat is close to the surface. Within a chip there are places called \xe2\x80\x9chotspots,\xe2\x80\x9d which are areas of localized high temperatures.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese are to be avoided, otherwise they create failures.\xe2\x80\x9d said Shi. \xe2\x80\x9cOur targeted applications are heat sensors, energy converters, etc. We want to be able to gauge that heat generated in devices if desired, or better yet, extract that heat and convert to electricity.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we are trying to do here is use the intrinsic property of material in tandem with the modern techniques of thermal solid state cooling to drive more heat out of the device,\xe2\x80\x9d said Postdoctoral Researcher Parijat Sengupta, who is working under the direction of Shi. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are looking at the internal arrangement of electrons, how they carry out the motion within the crystal, and how the motion gives rise to a certain kind of magnetic field, which is not applied from the outside. It is like having an internal magnetic field and it creates an additional avenue to drive more heat out of the device.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The researchers theoretically quantified how much heat can be driven, and they discovered that a lot of heat is produced, and the energy can be harvested.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou drive current through a device \xe2\x80\x93 so you are applying voltage \xe2\x80\x93 and in turn you are receiving heat, which usually goes to waste. We are trying to use that heat in multiple ways,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shi.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe heat can be utilized by driving a thermal power generator, where the heat produces electricity again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sengupta. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso, we can use heat to drive \xe2\x80\x98spin currents,\xe2\x80\x99 which is the internal attribute of the electron.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDriven by the motivation to do energy harvesting, we chose a material where extra impetus can be had from the material\xe2\x80\x99s internal arrangement of atoms and electrons and see what are the optimal experimental setups we can look for that maximize the heat flow,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sengupta.'
b'The researchers are using thermal power generators from an application standpoint because of the heat that it can draw out and drive another generator. There are two effects called the Seebeck effect and the Peltier effect, which are at play in the research.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I drive heat through this material that will create a temperature gradient and that gives rise to voltage that you can use for something else. That\xe2\x80\x99s the primary goal in mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sengupta. \xe2\x80\x9cThe second is the spin current. We introduced the spin of electrons into our work. That is what makes this research interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The\xc2\xa0Seebeck effect\xc2\xa0is a phenomenon in which a temperature difference between two dissimilar electrical conductors or semiconductors produces a voltage difference between the two substances.'
b'The\xc2\xa0Peltier effect\xc2\xa0is the phenomenon that a potential difference applied across a thermocouple\xc2\xa0causes a temperature difference between the junctions of the different materials in the\xc2\xa0thermocouple. This\xc2\xa0effect\xc2\xa0is the opposite of the Seebeck effect.'
