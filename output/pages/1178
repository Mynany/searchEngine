b'Mechanical engineering is one of the oldest fields of engineering, yet it is constantly evolving through its applications in emerging areas. Today, mechanical engineers are not only trained in traditional fields such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, machine design, and controls, but they also learn how to apply the fundamental principles from engineering, physics, chemistry and mathematics to address complex problems in interdisciplinary areas such as biomedical engineering and nanotechnology. Mechanical engineering also is one of the broadest fields of engineering and its graduates find jobs in various industries such as energy, aerospace, manufacturing, robotics, and medical devices, just to name a few.
