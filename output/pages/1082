b'Circuit assembly'
b'We have two soldering irons for student use. They are both set to 750F and should not be changed. If you need a different tip ask staff for help as they are very fragile.\nAdditionally we have a hot air rework station for SMD components.\nWe have a desolder gun for disassembly as well.'
b'We also have a large number of tools including wire strippers, cutters, crimpers, holding jigs, and torches.'

b'Materials available'
b'We have basic PVC coated wire in many gauges, both stranded and solid core.\nWe provide solder and flux.'
b'We do not provide electronic components. While we have some basic things students can use such as various resistors, capacitors, crimp terminals, and transistors we do not guarantee anything specific is in stock. It is expected that students are bringing their own components for projects.'
