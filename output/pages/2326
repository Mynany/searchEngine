b'Dr. Sudip Mazumder, ECE Professor, has received a new NSF $315,575 grant. Prof. Mazumder is PI on the project entitled \xe2\x80\x9cNovel Optically-Activated High-Voltage and Single-Bias Wide-Bandgap High-Frequency Thyristor for Next-Generation Smart Grid\xe2\x80\x9d, Award No. ECCS-1202384, effective October 1 , 2012 and expiring September 30, 2015. The objectives of this project are to: 1) realize and optimize a high-gain, high voltage, and high-temperature SiC integrated thyristor; 2) reduce the optical-triggering power requirement of the thyristor; and 3) experimentally characterize the fabricated prototype device for performance validation.'
