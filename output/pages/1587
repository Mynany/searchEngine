b'GradSWE President'
b'Major:\xc2\xa0Computer science \xe2\x80\x93 PhD'
b'Fun fact:\xc2\xa0I wanted to become an astronaut (just like many other kids!). Then I found out I cannot be a female astronaut in my country. When I was at the hight of disappointment, I saw Anousheh Ansari who was the first space traveler to go to space. She lived my dreams and she was an Electrical Engineer- Computer Scientist! So I decided to follow her footsteps and become a very rich Electrical Engineer- Computer Scientist and then go to space! I\xe2\x80\x99m ECE alumni and currently studying PhD at CS department. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a light year away from my dreams.'

b'Fun fact: I started playing violin when I was 8, but when I turned 18 I chose to become a Materials Engineer, the most opposite to arts and now I\xe2\x80\x99m getting my Ph.D. in it! So, I\xc2\xa0made a violin out of metal!'
