b"Biography\nProfessor Ansari's research is in experimental Biophysics. She has worked extensively on characterizing the conformational dynamics of proteins and the kinetics of relaxation from a non-equilibrium ensemble of conformations. Current efforts in her laboratory are directed toward understanding the principles behind secondary structure formation in single-stranded DNA, RNA and proteins, with the application of theoretical and computational models from statistical mechanics of polymers to better understand the experiments. She uses time-resolved absorbance and fluorescence measurements following a 10 nanosecond laser temperature-jump to probe the dynamics of the biological macromolecules. Professor Ansari received the National Science Foundation CAREER award for her research in 1998. "
