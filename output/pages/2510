b'PhD Candidate John Novak (top) and Prof. Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s paper \xe2\x80\x9cEffects of User Controlled Speech Rateon Intelligibilityin Noisy Environments\xe2\x80\x9d was nominated for INTERSPEECH 2018, in Hyderabad, India this September.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that? I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear over the background noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0PhD Candidate John Novak and Professor Robert Kenyon set out to address the issue of helping people understand speech better in difficult situations by developing computerized tools customized to user needs with their research paper, \xe2\x80\x9cEffects of User Controlled Speech Rate on Intelligibility in Noisy Environments.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Their paper was one of twelve nominated out of hundreds of accepted papers and over 2,500 submissions for INTERSPEECH 2018 being held in Hyderabad, India September 2-6. INTERSPEECH is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest and most comprehensive conference on the science and\xc2\xa0technology of spoken language processing. Novak explained their research in more detail.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficult\xc2\xa0situation is a type of background noise called \xe2\x80\x98cocktail party noise,\xe2\x80\x99 which is exactly what it sounds like: multiple people talking in the background of a target voice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe computer mediated tool was a method of artificially slowing speech without causing distortion, especially without dropping the pitch of the voices. This is something that talkers do naturally [in addition to speaking louder] to help their listeners, but we wanted to put some control in the hands of the listener. We believe this is very important, although very difficult to achieve.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The nomination was a surprise for Novak. \xe2\x80\x9cI was as confident about this as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been about any other submission but being nominated for a best student paper award never even entered my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Besides the surprise of being nominated, Novak was especially grateful for the support he has received from \xe2\x80\x9cvarious mentors, advisors, and sounding boards I\xe2\x80\x99ve found here at UIC including most especially Professor Robert Kenyon'
b'and everyone at the Electronics Visualization Lab, and Professor Valeriy Shafiro, an audiologist at Rush University, who got me interested in this line of research in the first place. And of course the many volunteers and test subjects who have taken part in these experiments,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Novak will present his research on September 2nd at the beginning of the conference in hopes of landing a best student paper award. Regardless, Novak already sees the entire experience as a win already. \xe2\x80\x9cI have only even been outside the United States once, before, so I am very excited about the trip,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a working trip, so I am looking forward to workshops, renewing acquaintances, and putting faces to more of the researchers I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in contact with mostly through e-mail.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'ABSTRACT'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTalkers intentionally producing high-intelligibility speech for listeners in challenging situations often reduce their speech rate. This study affords listeners fine-grained control over the playback rate of a desired speech signal in varying levels of background noise, and tests listener intelligibility with their preferred and unmodified rates of speech. \xc2\xa0We find clear listener preference for decreased rates of speech as background noise increased. However, we also found degraded performance on a speech-in-noise intelligibility test relative to unmodified speech in these same conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d'
