b'Featured Visualization'
b"Instead of a visualization (see our visualization page), this time we feature a video on our main page as CSUN Director Sybil Derrible was invited to give a TEDx talk at Walter Payton College Prep High School in Chicago last April. The theme of the TEDx was The Power of Positivity. As an urban engineer, Prof. Derrible naturally had to spin the theme around cities. More precisely, by going back 2,500 years, he discusses how cities are often shaped by the challenges they face and he then discusses how cities may evolve in the future.  Don't hesitate to send us your comments, we hope you enjoy the talk. "
