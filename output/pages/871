b'More than 300 people \xe2\x80\x94 kids with cancer or sickle cell disease and their families \xe2\x80\x94 celebrated the holidays at UIC Nov. 17. The event, which was hosted by the pediatric hematology/oncology department of the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital University of Illinois, included a Thanksgiving-inspired meal, holiday crafts, dancing and a gift exchange.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cToday is not about being a doctor or a patient,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Mary Lou Schmidt, professor of pediatrics and head of pediatric hematology and oncology. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about having fun.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Volunteers from the Girl Scouts, A Silver Lining, Bear Necessities and others helped kids use paint, paper, beads and a host of other materials to make holiday crafts. Students from the UIC College of Dentistry dressed up as tooth fairies and as \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Molar,\xe2\x80\x9d encouraging kids to practice good brushing habits with a novelty-sized toothbrush and stuffed animals. Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts provided supplies so kids could decorate their donuts, and eat their dessert before lunch if desired. The Joffrey Ballet\xe2\x80\x99s Exelon Strobel Dancers danced for and with attendees, young and old.'
b'For Kelly, mom of an 18-month-old\xc2\xa0with leukemia, the event was also a celebration of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s progress.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKathryn was diagnosed one year ago today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this time last year, we were in the hospital. To see her running around today, healthy, means everything.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The event was also meaningful to Kelly because two of Kathryn\xe2\x80\x99s three siblings were also there, along with their dad and Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s husband, Dan.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had to spend so much time apart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kelly, who spent more than 190 days in the hospital last year with her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cFinding time to be together means everything.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Schmidt says the event is about relationships\xc2\xa0and celebration.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cCancer or sickle cell and a number of other conditions have touched everyone in this room, but we have so much to celebrate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have so many wonderful stories to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Javontae, 24, a Hodgkin\xe2\x80\x99s lymphoma\xc2\xa0survivor, attended the event with his mom, sister, friend and a few cousins.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love being here with my family,\xe2\x80\x9d said Javontae, who has been in remission for eight years. He said that while most of the activities are for younger kids, he still has a good time, especially with his younger family members.'
b'Supporting the event were more than 50 UIC volunteers, primarily from the College of Medicine, and 10 organizations, including Flashes of Hope, Gilda\xe2\x80\x99s Club, Holiday Heroes, Ladies Philoptochos Society and North Star Reach.'
