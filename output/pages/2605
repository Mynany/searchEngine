b'Communities are defined\xc2\xa0by flux: friendships that form and break, loyalties\xc2\xa0that shift, and visitors passing through. But\xc2\xa0these dynamic interactions\xc2\xa0aren\xe2\x80\x99t represented\xc2\xa0in static maps of social networks. Snapshot diagrams \xe2\x80\x93 with\xc2\xa0lines drawn between individuals to show the ties that connect them based on data collected over time \xe2\x80\x93 can\xe2\x80\x99t tell the whole story.'
b'Zoologists are similarly hampered when trying to\xc2\xa0analyze the community organization of social animals. The bonding behaviors\xc2\xa0of related species may seem\xc2\xa0similar, even though the environments that shaped the\xc2\xa0animals\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0group-behavior are quite different.'
b'Two such closely related species are the endangered Grevy\xe2\x80\x99s zebra of Africa\xe2\x80\x94the largest surviving\xc2\xa0wild equid \xe2\x80\x94 and the onager, a wild ass of Asia. A new, dynamic social-network analysis tool has revealed\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0the two species\xc2\xa0actually have radically different social behaviors and community structures.'
b'The study\xc2\xa0was published online in PLOS ONE.'

b'University of Illinois at Chicago computational ecologist Tanya Berger-Wolf led the multi-disciplinary team that\xc2\xa0created CommDy, a\xc2\xa0dynamic network computational framework, to better understand group behavior and community.'
b'Both Grevy\xe2\x80\x99s zebra and the Asian wild asses form\xc2\xa0what are\xc2\xa0known as fission/fusion communities, said Berger-Wolf, who is\xc2\xa0associate professor of\xc2\xa0computer science at UIC. In fission/fusion communities, individuals meet and spend time\xc2\xa0with others in\xc2\xa0different groups at different times.'
b'The\xc2\xa0two animals\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0communities look similar,\xc2\xa0using\xc2\xa0a traditionally static social-network analysis. But the zebras are few in number, limited in range, and\xc2\xa0menaced by large\xc2\xa0predators\xc2\xa0such as\xc2\xa0lions. They often lack\xc2\xa0access to water.\xc2\xa0Onagers, in contrast, are relatively abundant and widespread, with no major predators and reliable access to water.\xc2\xa0One would expect the two species to have evolved very different social structures to cope with their different circumstances.'
b'To observe the daily interactions within each of the two animal communities, three study co-authors from the Mpala Research Centre\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0Kenya\xe2\x80\x93ecologists Daniel Rubenstein of Princeton University, Siva Sundaresan of the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance\xc2\xa0in Wyoming, and Ilya Fischoff of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0Washington, D.C. \xe2\x80\x94 drove repeatedly along\xc2\xa0the same route through the\xc2\xa0animals\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0territory and recorded\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0size, duration and membership of different groups. The software allowed the researchers\xc2\xa0to contextualize the observed interactions.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the latent community structure \xe2\x80\x94 loyalties, changes in affiliation, visiting with other groups \xe2\x80\x94 and the social cost of change,\xe2\x80\x9d Berger-Wolf\xc2\xa0said. Some\xc2\xa0interactions may have a negative impact for\xc2\xa0an individual, she said, by\xc2\xa0increasing stress or inviting harassment.\xc2\xa0Other social contacts may be\xc2\xa0positive, by increasing status or access to resources.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe dynamic communities that resulted from that computational analysis were actually strikingly different,\xe2\x80\x9d Berger-Wolf\xc2\xa0said. The Grevy\xe2\x80\x99s zebra lived in large, stable\xc2\xa0groups, with loyalty rewarded and visiting with other groups discouraged. Onagers formed smaller, less cohesive groups, with individuals able to\xc2\xa0change\xc2\xa0circles\xc2\xa0with little\xc2\xa0social cost.'
b'Berger-Wolf said these newly\xc2\xa0revealed\xc2\xa0differences make\xc2\xa0sense, given the different\xc2\xa0adaptation\xc2\xa0each\xc2\xa0species\xc2\xa0needed to survive. And for the first time, scientists were able to quantify the differences, using the computational tool.'
b'Facing a constant threat from a\xc2\xa0predator, the Grevy\xe2\x80\x99s zebra finds strength in numbers,\xc2\xa0forming large groups of loyal individuals. The large, stable herd\xc2\xa0is also able to share\xc2\xa0found resources, like water. The onager, in contrast, can form smaller, more transient groups, being\xc2\xa0less dependent on the herd\xc2\xa0for protection or finding scarce resources.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDynamic community analysis can be an important tool for testing ideas about the selective ecological and evolutionary forces that generate behaviors, revealing their adaptive value and significance,\xe2\x80\x9d Berger-Wolf said.'
