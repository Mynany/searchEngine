b'Undergraduates who engage in supervised\xc2\xa0research, scholarship, and creative endeavors experience positive\xc2\xa0personal, academic, and professional benefits beyond those provided by\xc2\xa0other college experiences. The UIC\xc2\xa0Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR)\xc2\xa0offers UIC students from all backgrounds and in all majors information and resources that help them find, secure, and\xc2\xa0succeed in such experiences\xe2\x80\x93on and off campus and nationally and internationally. The OUR also supports faculty and staff in mentoring\xc2\xa0students and garnering funding for their projects.\xc2\xa0We are home to a number of signature initiatives, including the Undergraduate Research Experience\xc2\xa0opportunity database and the Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s Undergraduate Research Award, and a partner with campus units on several others.'
