b"Standards for admission to membership in the Faculty of the Graduate College are determined jointly by the Dean and the Executive Committee of the Graduate College.\xc2\xa0 There are four levels of membership:\xc2\xa0 Full, Associate, Adjunct and Courtesy.\xc2\xa0 Note that the levels of membership are different than the professor's rank of full professor, associate professor, etc., even though some of the same terminology is used for both."
b'List of UIC Graduate College Faculty'
b'View\xc2\xa0a current complete\xc2\xa0list of Graduate College Faculty\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0- last updated October 2018 (Excel spreadheet).\xc2\xa0 This listing should be used by student and programs forming examination committees.'
b'complete\xc2\xa0list of Graduate College Faculty\xc2\xa0'
b'Listings of\xc2\xa0Graduate Faculty\xc2\xa0with Full or Associate membership in the Graduate College are listed in\xc2\xa0Graduate Faculty section of the online Graduate Catalog.\xc2\xa0 This listing does not include retired faculty who retain membership nor does it include Adjunct or Courtesy members.\xc2\xa0 Consult the complete list above for that information.'
b'Graduate Faculty section of the online Graduate Catalog'
b'Membership Categories'
b'Membership categories of Graduate College Faculty allow different\xc2\xa0rights and privileges pertaining to student mentoring and serving on student committees.\xc2\xa0 The following is excerpted from the Bylaws of the Graduate College.'
b'Bylaws of the Graduate College'
b'Full Membership'
b'Full Membership is granted for the term of employment to tenured or tenure track faculty in a UIC department that houses a program under the umbrella of the Graduate College who have been recommended by the department or other teaching or research divisions and approved by the Dean. In the College of Medicine recommendations for full membership are limited to appointments in the Research Track.'
b'Retired faculty with Full\xc2\xa0membership automatically retain their memberships at the same level for three years after retirement. In special cases membership can be extended upon request to the Graduate Dean by the Executive Officer attesting to the fact that the nominated faculty is still active in graduate education.'
b'Associate Membership'
b'Associate members are typically clinical track or non-tenure system faculty whose program wishes to grant them the right to serve as primary advisors to students in that program. Once appointed, Associate members retain their memberships so long as they continue to meet the criteria. Associate Membership is granted upon recommendation to the Dean by the Executive Officer of the department or equivalent unit. The nominating department must take a vote of the Full members of the Graduate Faculty on the question of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s membership. The results of that vote must accompany the membership request. In exceptional circumstances, distinguished individuals without a UIC appointment may be proposed for Associate membership and approved for a fixed term.'
b'Retired faculty with\xc2\xa0Associate membership automatically retain their memberships at the same level for three years after retirement. In special cases membership can be extended upon request to the Graduate Dean by the Executive Officer attesting to the fact that the nominated faculty is still active in graduate education.'
b'Adjunct Membership'
b'Adjunct members are typically UIC faculty or other employees who possess expertise that makes it likely and desirable for them to serve repeatedly on graduate student committees. Adjunct members must be UIC employees. They are appointed for three-year (renewable) terms through a recommendation to the Graduate Dean from the Executive Officer of the department or equivalent unit.'
b'Courtesy Membership'
b'Courtesy members are typically non-UIC employees who possess some expertise that makes them desirable members of a particular graduate student committee. Courtesy members are appointed to sit on a specific committee, and need to be reappointed for each committee. Courtesy members are appointed through a recommendation to the Graduate Dean from the Executive Officer of the department or equivalent unit.\xc2\xa0'
b'Graduate College Faculty Memberhip Nominations'
b"Graduate Faculty do not nominate themselves for membership. The Nomination Form for Graduate College Faculty Membership must be subitted from the Executive Officer's (typically head or chair) office, of an academic department or equivalent unit that holds a graduate degree program.\xc2\xa0"
b'Nomination Form for Graduate College Faculty Membership'
b"If a faculty member is erronously omited from the list (see above), contact your unit's Executive Officer."
