b'I graduated with my bachelors degree and two more graduate degrees after that from the University of Illinois at Chicago. The campus, student body, and university culture has changed over the last thirty years, but it is an excellent university that has given me so much more than I had originally anticipated. I am returning in 2019 to earn my fourth masters degree in educational policy studies and teacher leadership. I highly recommend this excellent and diverse university for anyone interested in pursuing higher education in the Chicagoland area.'

b'I will go to UIC, Urban college on the eastern side this August, and UIC does have a great service, I have kept a good connection via email with international student department. And whenever I have something to discuss with the housing department, they respond within two days. Quite convenient to talk to them. Also, as a Chinese student, the most I need is the social life in UIC, then they just reminded me of the International student orientation, and the BBQ dinner, musical festival and some activities else. For the courses are interesting enough, especially the microeconomics and data analysis, principal of urban theory and so on. Hope to meet more friends this Fall.'
