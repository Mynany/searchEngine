b'Photo Services'
b'Images are an important component of UIC\xe2\x80\x99s identity, providing perspectives of life in Chicago and showcasing the university\xe2\x80\x99s academic excellence and accomplishments. Departments using photography and video in print and digital communications are encouraged to follow these guidelines and policies. The internal resources listed below can provide high quality photos and video for your needs.'
b'Keys to successful photo and video projects'
b'All campus units should use professional-quality images that represent the campus, its diverse students, faculty and staff and its\xc2\xa0academic and research endeavors in a positive light. Imagery should feel true to the university. The use of negative space and color is encouraged to showcase UIC\xe2\x80\x99s vibrancy.'
b'Copyright and Permissions'
b'When working with outside photographers, make sure that all contracts specify that\xc2\xa0UIC will own exclusive rights to the use of the images. This will allow the images to be used for\xc2\xa0current and future projects without having to purchase additional rights.'
b'Photo Release'
b'Other than those photographed for news coverage by independent news organizations, any individuals who may be identified by their image must sign a photo release form\xc2\xa0before they are photographed for a UIC project. The release gives UIC permission to use the photo in\xc2\xa0any university communication vehicle or any outside medium used to represent the campus. It\xc2\xa0acknowledges that the signatory understands that the information may be published and shown in\xc2\xa0public and that there will be no compensation provided for its use.'
