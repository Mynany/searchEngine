b'Leadership'
b'Student Leadership and Civic Engagement believes that leadership is the process by which individuals facilitate positive social change. Anchored in the Social Change Model of Leadership Development, we believe that everyone can lead and create positive change at UIC and in the greater community. Our programs and workshops provide opportunities for students to explore and discover their personal style of leadership, while building skills to help them succeed in their academic and professional lives. We emphasize the connections between individuals, groups, and community, and focus on helping students link their passions to a greater cause.'
