b'Data scientist wins award to develop malaria monitoring platform'
b'\n\t\t\t\tJune 22, 2017\t\t\t'
b'Isabel Cruz, professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has been named a Grand Challenges Explorations winner, an initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.'

b'Isabel Cruz, professor of computer science in the UIC College of Engineering.'
b'Cruz, whose project is among 28 to be funded of the approximately 1,500 proposals submitted, will develop a data integration platform to monitor and predict the location of cases of malaria over time with her $100,000 award. The data will be used to drive targeted mosquito elimination efforts.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to eliminate malaria, we need to be able to accurately monitor the changing patterns of infection across an entire region,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cInfection rates may be affected by multiple factors including the location of health centers, temperature, rainfall, type of landscape and population distribution.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Data integration is difficult because they come from different sources and are measured at different resolutions, according to Cruz.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, monitoring how a disease changes over space and time has been particularly challenging because data integration methods are for the most part space and time oblivious,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.'
b'Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite and people who contract it often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness. Left untreated, they may develop severe complications and die.'
b'Cruz will use data from Zimbabwe to develop her methods. More than 400,000 cases of malaria are reported in Zimbabwe each year, representing approximately three percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s total population. Half of Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s population is at risk for contracting malaria despite measures to combat the disease including through mosquito control methods and disease screening programs. Of Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s 63 districts, 47 consistently report cases of malaria, and 33 of the districts are categorized as high-burden malaria zones.'
b'Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s project will integrate data on malaria rates, weather patterns and population distribution from world and government sources into a standardized format.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe data we need to track malaria comes from so many different sources that without a standardized way of integrating it so that it can be useful, we can\xe2\x80\x99t really make well-informed predictions about which areas may experience an increase in malaria in the near future,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Ultimately, the sorted and standardized data will be visualized in maps and dashboards that will display patterns of malaria progression in real time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis information will help inform public health workers, government responders and others, as to where to target their efforts to reduce the incidence of malaria,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said.'
b'Cruz also anticipates that her integrated data displays may allow researchers to better understand which factors influence malaria rates the most and why.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that precipitation has a big impact on malaria rates because mosquitoes depend on having standing water such a puddles, for breeding, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how big of a factor this is compared to other factors like temperature and land cover,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Grand Challenges Explorations is a $100 million initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Launched in 2008, more than 1,285 projects in more than 65 countries have received Grand Challenges Explorations grants. Initial grants of $100,000 are awarded twice per year and successful projects have the opportunity to receive a follow-on grant of up to $1 million.'
