b'GRADUATE'
b"Graduate college site on 'Funding your Education' is a good place to start on understanding funding your education in general. They give general information on all types of funding and how to go about finding it. The CS department has teaching assistantships (TA), research assistantships (RA), tution fee waivers (TFW) and department endorsed fellowships offered by the graduate college. Teaching Assistantship applications are available, through the student affairs office, at the end of Fall/Spring semester for the following semester/academic year to continuing graduate students. Research assistantships are available through individual faculty members and we encourage you to contact the faculty in your research interests for availability. Limited number of tution waivers from the graduate college are available for the department each semester, applications for these are the same as for TA. Graduate college has a number of Fellowships for continuing students that have to be endorsed by the department. The fellowships indicated below are required to be submitted and/or sponsored by the director of graduate studies (DGS) and so the deadline for these is weeks/days ahead of the graduate college deadline. All deadlines indicated are department deadlines, by which all necessary application materials and recommendation lettes have to be submitted to the DGS/Student Affairs Office. US Citizens and Immigrants should contact the UIC Financial Aid Office for information on student loans and grants. There are several forms of financial aid available to incoming graduate students."

b'  UIC University Fellowship'
b'UIC University Fellowship'
b'One of the most prestigious and thus the most competitive form of financial aid is the UIC University Fellowship. The department has to nominate applicants for this award. To be considered for nomination to the University Fellowship, your application must be complete by and ready for review by mid January. These deadlines are strictly enforced.'
b'Teaching Assistantship'
b'Teaching Assistantships are awarded to applicants with outstanding academic records, in addition to proven communication skills. TA\xe2\x80\x99s assist in the teaching and grading of course work under the supervision and direction of an assigned instructor. Decisions regarding TA\xe2\x80\x99s for the Fall semester are typically made mid March. Awarded applicants are contacted via email.'
b'A typical award of this type is a 50% appointment which requires the student to work 20 hours/week of their TA duties. The stipend for this award was $18,229 for the 2016-17 academic year. In addition the award carries a waiver of tuition, service fee, health service fee, AFMFA, LITA, and 40% of CampusCare insurance fee in Fall and Spring semsters, if applicable. All other fees are the responsibility of the student.'
b'Research Assistantship'
b'Research assistantships are awarded by individual faculty members based on their needs and available research funding. RA\xe2\x80\x99s assist faculty in funded research projects.  Applicants interested in these should contact faculty (link to faculty page) in their area of research directly after being admitted by the department.  Be selective in your correspondence to only the faculty whose research interests match your own; faculty are generally non-responsive to "broadcast" appeals for financial aid.  Stipend is similar to teaching assistantship'
b'Tuition and Fee Waiver'
b'A limited number of Tuition and Fee waivers are available on a competitive basis for PhD students. These cover the cost of all tuition (including differential), service fee, health service fee, academic facilities maintenance fund assessment, library and information technology assessment, and 40% of CampusCare insurance fee in Fall and Spring semsters, if applicable. All other fees are the financial responsibility of the student. These waivers are usually not awarded until just prior to the beginning of the semester. After admission and arrival at the university, please stop by the Student Affairs Office for further information on an application for this award.'
b'IGERT Fellowship'
b'A limited number of IGERT Fellowships are available on a competitive basis for incoming or current PhD students. Due to requirements by NSF, these Fellowships are available only for US citizens or permanent residents. These Fellowships offer a stipend plus Tuition and Fee waiver. The application for these fellowships must be sent to the ESP-IGERT program. For more details about this program and application procedures, please visit http://securityigert.uic.edu.'
