b'University Degree Requirements'
b''
b'UIC has several degree requirements that apply to all students pursuing an undergraduate degree, regardless of major. University degree requirements serve as minimum standards; many colleges set higher standards than the minimum required by the university. A student must always fulfill the degree requirements outlined by the major college.'
b'University degree requirements bring a level of consistency and quality to all undergraduate degrees awarded at UIC. By setting standards that are met or exceeded by the colleges, the university ensures the integrity of all the degrees it awards.'
b'University degree requirements include the following:'
b'General Education'
b'The minimum university degree requirements are outlined below. Important Note: Students should consult their college section of the catalog for specific information on how to meet the degree requirements set by the college.'
b'General Education Requirements'
b''
b'Students should consult the General Education section of the catalog for a complete description of the university\xe2\x80\x99s General Education Program as well as their college/department sections of the catalog to determine how to fulfill the General Education requirements within their degree program.'
b'General Education'
b'Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement'
b''
b'All candidates for a degree must have at least a 2.00/4.00 grade point average in all work taken at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in all work taken in the major field, and in all work accepted by the university (transfer work plus work taken at UIC). A student may be required to meet higher minimum grade point averages in certain degree programs.'
b'Students should consult their college section of the catalog for more information on the grade point average requirement for their degree program.'
b'Enrollment Residence Requirement'
b''
b'The enrollment residence requirement must be satisfied. In all academic units except the College of Business Administration, either the first 90 semester hours or the last 30 semester hours of university work must be taken at UIC. In the College of Business Administration, the last 30 semester hours must be taken at UIC. In addition, at least one-half of the semester hours required in the student\xe2\x80\x99s major area of study must be completed at UIC. Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another collegiate institution, or enrollment during the summer at another institution, when approved by the student\xe2\x80\x99s college, does not interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement for graduation. Credit earned through CLEP and proficiency examinations, and through the University of Illinois Guided Individual Study and extramural courses, neither applies toward nor interrupts the enrollment residence requirement. Under exceptional circumstances, the enrollment residence requirement may be waived by the dean of the student\xe2\x80\x99s college upon petition of the student.'
b'A student must complete at least one-half of the course work required for the minor field in enrollment residence at the University of Illinois at Chicago.'
b'60-Hour Requirement'
b''
b'Credit approved for transfer from an accredited community or junior college is limited only by the provision that the student must earn at least 60 semester hours required for the degree at the University of Illinois at Chicago or at any other accredited four-year college or university, except that the student must meet the enrollment residence requirements that apply to all students for a degree from UIC.'
b'Semester Hour Requirement'
b''
b'The minimum number of semester hours required for a degree is 120. The required number of hours varies within the colleges, schools, and degree programs. The student should refer to the section of this catalog that covers the college and curriculum to determine the hours required for a particular degree. The college office also provides this information.'
b'Policies Affecting Degree Requirements and Graduation'
b''
b'Admission Requirements'
b''
b'All admission requirements for the student\xe2\x80\x99s chosen degree program must be met.'
b'Deficiencies'
b''
b'All deficiencies in entrance credit must be removed prior to graduation.'
b'Degree Program Name Change'
b''
b'If a college, school, department, or program changes the name of a major or curriculum or the title of a degree program as a result of reorganization, continuing students in the affected major, curriculum, or degree program will be transferred to the newly titled/named major, curriculum, or degree program.'
b'Degree Requirements'
b''
b'Students must meet all requirements of their chosen college and degree program.'
b'When degree requirements change, continuing students and those whose attendance has been interrupted for no more than two years may choose either the new requirements or the degree requirements in effect at the time the students were admitted. Students whose attendance has been interrupted for more than two years are responsible for meeting the requirements of the University and college as well as the degree program in effect at the time of the student\xe2\x80\x99s reenrollment.'
b'If a curriculum is eliminated in its entirety, or if required courses are eliminated from a particular curriculum, the department, school, or college reserves the right to offer substitute courses as deemed appropriate by the unit\xe2\x80\x99s faculty. Students may have to fulfill new requirements when external accrediting or certifying agencies change their professional requirements.'
b'Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses'
b''
b'Students may repeat a course to increase their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under which repeating a course is advisable and to a student\xe2\x80\x99s advantage. There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage a student and narrow a student\xe2\x80\x99s options. Some colleges require students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic advisor before they register to repeat the course.'
b'Courses with A or B grades may not be repeated. Normally, courses with a C grade may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.'
b'To repeat a course more than once requires written permission from the student\xe2\x80\x99s college dean. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should consult their college before repeating a course.'
b'Double Major, Double Degrees, and Second Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Degree'
b''
b'The following general definitions are offered for informational purposes. Students should consult their college section of the catalog for information about the options available to them and the policies associated with those options. In addition, students should check with an academic advisor before pursuing one of these options.'
b'A double major consists of one bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree with two majors. A double major does not ordinarily have, as a requirement, additional semester hours beyond those required for a single major. To double major, students must complete all of the requirements for two majors within one college. A double major is generally not permitted when there is substantial overlap in course work between the two majors.'
b'Double degrees consist of two bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degrees completed concurrently. Double degrees require a minimum of 30 additional semester hours beyond those required for the first degree. To receive double degrees, students must formally request acceptance into the second degree program and complete all requirements for each of the degree programs. Double degrees can be within one college or across two colleges. Students who obtain double degrees receive a diploma for each degree. Double degrees are generally not permitted when there is substantial overlap in course work between the two degree programs. No more than two bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degrees may be awarded concurrently.'
b'A second bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree is available only for students who have already been awarded a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree at UIC or another institution. A second bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree requires a minimum of 30 semester hours at UIC after completion of the first degree. Students must apply to, be admitted, and complete the requirements for the second bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree. A second bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree is generally not permitted when there is substantial overlap in course work between the first and second degrees. Students pursuing two degrees concurrently must follow the policies for Double Degrees, not Second Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Degree.'
