b'Last Updated 10/18/2017'
b'Also see the UIC Style Guidelines and the Associated Press Stylebook for additional guidance.'
b'UIC Style Guidelines'
b'Associated Press Stylebook'
b'Content Creation & Maintenance'
b'In order for content to be useful, usable, accessible and findable, we must deliberately plan for the full lifecycle of content and services and build in assessment at each step. This lifecycle and the workflows involved in each phase are outlined below. Content and services can range from small scale projects, such as the addition of a new section on a web page, to large scale content review and revision for an individual site.'
b'Content Lifecycle'
b'The planning process can take anywhere from a few minutes for a small blurb on a web page, to a few months or years for a large scale web project.'
b'If content does not meet content design principles or if there is no longer a primary stakeholder to manage it, it will be withdrawn.'
b'Content roles'
b'Content authors directly edit content on a web property. They are required to uphold the Content Strategy and Web Style Guide, and participate in regular content assessment. Content authors must also complete a minimum level of training in writing for the web and using the content management platform on which they create content.'
b'Within a web property, content authors may have different levels of roles and permissions, and some authors may have additional editorial responsibilities to approve and publish the work of other authors. Content authors may also have different roles in different web properties.'
b'Content author roles are set by the site owner.'
b'Every piece of content should have a content owner who is responsible for maintaining it through its full lifecycle. A web property owner assigns content ownership. If a department, committee or working group is the content owner, the chair or head will be ultimately responsible for the content.'
b'Web property owners lead efforts to maintain and create all content on the site. They set content authoring permissions, assign ownership of content, and lead regular content review efforts. A site owner may be one person or the chairs of a working group or committee.'
b'Writing Goals & Principles'
b'Guiding principles for the UIC web presence are:'
b'Focusing on the User'
b'User needs drive all of the content and services that make up the web presence. All web content and services are regularly assessed through user testing and use data. Areas of the web presence that do not meet the standards of our users are retired or improved.'
b'Inclusion'
b'The web presence respects and builds upon the varied skills, backgrounds, and experiences of its diverse users through inclusive language and services. The tone of all web content should be friendly and easily understandable to a diverse audience.'
b'Fairness to all'
b'The web presence works to ensure equal access to information by providing services that meet or exceed standards for accessibility and usability.'
b'Researched Methods'
b'The web presence operates on evidence-based best practices and original research with our users.'
b'Thinking outside the box'
b'The web presence employs innovative new services and information practices that improve the online delivery of Library resources and services to our users.'
b'Public Relations'
b'The web presence consists of services that engage with users and collaborators in the University, in Chicago, and with communities throughout the State, the Midwest region, and beyond.'
b'User Data Security'
b'The web presence protects and upholds the University\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to maintain the privacy of users of University websites.'
b'Writing For The Web'
b'Why is writing for the web different?'
b'How to have a conversation with users'
b'For each piece of content, ask:'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSummary first\xe2\x80\x9d structure'
b'Structure your content so that users can find the answers to their questions quickly. Summarize the essential information first, then reveal the information that supports it.'
b'Other general guidelines'
b'Voice & Tone'
b'Our voice is our unique personality. Just as a person\xe2\x80\x99s voice remains largely the same, so should the voice of our web presence. A well-crafted voice communicates our personality and values.'
b'UIC\xe2\x80\x99s voice is described in the UIC Style Guide under Lexicon.'
b'UIC Style Guide under Lexicon'
b'Determine tone through context'
b'Tone is more like attitude \xe2\x80\x94 the emotional context of a piece. Just as a person\xe2\x80\x99s tone of voice changes to fit the somberness or lightness of a situation, so can the tone of writing used throughout our web presence.'
b'To connect with people and show you care, you have to meet your users where they are. Think about the situation your readers are in. What did they come here for? Blog posts can be personal and casual, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re writing a technical document to help someone troubleshoot, you probably need to take on an instructional tone. You can be a little more dramatic or persuasive in a marketing campaign than in your help center.'
b'Above all, when you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about tone, consider the context of the message. For example, if you\xe2\x80\x99re giving directions, you can naturally assume that readers need help finding their way.'
b'The next step is to think about your reader\xe2\x80\x99s emotional state. Try to understand their frame of mind and talk to them where they are. Find out what happens just before your message appears. Is this good news that will make readers feel happy, relieved, or excited, or is it bad news that will make them frustrated, angry, or upset? Will the message brighten their day, or put them in a difficult situation? Are readers prepared, or will they be caught off guard? These questions will help you decide how to write the message.'
b'Writing About People'
b'View each accordion below for guidelines on how to describe people\xc2\xa0(from the MailChimp Content Style Guide.'
b'MailChimp Content Style Guide'
b'Remember, words matter.'
b'Additional information on the power of language is provided by the UIC Office of Diversity.'
b'UIC Office of Diversity'
b'Chronological References'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t reference a person\xe2\x80\x99s age unless it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to what you\xe2\x80\x99re writing. If it is relevant, include the person\xe2\x80\x99s specific age, offset by commas:'
b'The CEO, 16, just got her drivers license.'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t refer to people using age-related descriptors like \xe2\x80\x9cyoung,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cold,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9celderly.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Accommodating All People'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t refer to a person\xe2\x80\x99s disability unless it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to what you\xe2\x80\x99re writing. If you need to mention it, use language that emphasizes the person first: \xe2\x80\x9cshe has a disability\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cshe is disabled.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When writing about a person with disabilities, don\xe2\x80\x99t use the words \xe2\x80\x9csuffer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cvictim,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chandicapped.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHandicapped parking\xe2\x80\x9d is OK.'
b'Gender Requirements'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t call groups of people \xe2\x80\x9cguys.\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t call women \xe2\x80\x9cgirls.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like \xe2\x80\x9cserver\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cwaitress\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbusinessperson\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cbusinessman.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s OK to use \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d as a singular pronoun.'
b'Use the following words as modifiers, but never as nouns:'
b'When writing about a person, use their preferred pronouns. If you\xe2\x80\x99re uncertain, just use their name.'
b'Acronym Explained'
b'Acceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning and/or queer. In quotations and the formal names of organizations and events, other forms such as LGBTQIA(+) and other variations are also acceptable with the other letters explained. I generally stands for intersex, and A can stand for allies (a person who is not LGBT but who actively supports the LGBT community), asexual (a person who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t experience sexual attraction) or both. The plus represents other identities that may fall under the umbrella.The word queer has been reclaimed by many LGBTQIA+ communities, but may be considered a slur in some contexts, so limit use of the word to quotes and names of organizations, following rules for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities as appropriate. Note that sex, gender and sexual orientation are not synonymous.'
b'Writing for Deaf People'
b'Use \xe2\x80\x9cdeaf\xe2\x80\x9d as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use \xe2\x80\x9cpartially deaf\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chard of hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Detailing an individual with a medical condition'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t refer to a person\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition unless it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to what you\xe2\x80\x99re writing.'
b'If a reference to a person\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Don\xe2\x80\x99t call a person with a medical condition a \xe2\x80\x9cvictim.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Detailing Psychological definitions'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t refer to a person\xe2\x80\x99s mental or cognitive condition unless it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to what you\xe2\x80\x99re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t describe a person as \xe2\x80\x9cmentally ill.\xe2\x80\x9d If a reference to a person\xe2\x80\x99s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.'
b'Writing for Blind people and those with low vision'
b'Use the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cblind\xe2\x80\x9d to describe a person who is unable to see. Use \xe2\x80\x9clow vision\xe2\x80\x9d to describe a person with limited vision.'
b'Web Elements'
b'Alt text'
b'Alt text is a way to label images, and it\xe2\x80\x99s especially important for people who can\xe2\x80\x99t see the images on our website. Alt text should describe the image in a brief sentence or two.'
b'Buttons'
b'Buttons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and concise. Capitalize every word, including articles. It\xe2\x80\x99s OK to use an ampersand in button copy.'
b'Standard website buttons include:'
b'Checkboxes'
b'Use sentence case for checkboxes.'
b'Drop-down menus'
b'Use title case for menu names and sentence case for menu items.'
b'Forms'
b'Form titles should clearly and quickly explain the purpose of the form.'
b'Use title case for form titles and sentence case for form fields.'
b'Keep forms as short as possible.'
b'Only request information that we need and intend to use. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for information that could be considered private or personal, including gender. If you need to ask for gender, provide a field the user can fill in on their own, not a drop-down menu.'
b'When writing microcopy on forms (i.e explanatory or instructional text that accompanies fields), be clear and concise. Microcopy should lend direction. Consider writing it an opportunity to further build a relationship with the user.'
b'Headings and subheadings'
b'Headings and subheadings organize content for readers. Be generous and descriptive.'
b'Headings (H1) give people a taste of what they\xe2\x80\x99re about to read. Use them for page and blog titles.'
b'Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable.'
b'Headings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order. (An H2 will nestle under H1, an H2 under H3, and on down.)'
b'Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings, and make sure you cover the main point of the content.'
b'Use title case for titles (H1), unless the heading is a punctuated sentence. If the heading is a punctuated sentence, use sentence case.'
b'Use sentence case (H2, H3, etc.) for subheadings regardless of end punctuation.'
b'Links'
b'Provide a link whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:'
b'Yes: Read the automation guide for details.'
b'No: Read the automation guide for details.'
b'If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don\xe2\x80\x99t link the punctuation mark.'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t say things like \xe2\x80\x9cClick here!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cClick for more information\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cRead this.\xe2\x80\x9d Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.'
b'Links should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they\xe2\x80\x99re interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state.'
b'Numbered & Bulleted Lists'
b'Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information. Give context for the list with a brief introduction. Number lists when the order is important, like when you\xe2\x80\x99re describing steps of a process. Don\xe2\x80\x99t use numbers when the list\xe2\x80\x99s order doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.'
b'If one of the list items is a complete sentence, use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items. If list items are not complete sentences, don\xe2\x80\x99t use punctuation, but do capitalize the first word of each item.'
b'Navigation'
b'Your main or global navigation is used to guide site visitors around your website. It should contain ONLY internal links to your site pages. External links to other websites, including other UIC sites, can appear in eyebrow or footer menus, but not your main/global navigation menu.'
b'Use title case for main or global navigation. Use sentence case for subnavigation.'
b'Navigation links should be clear and concise.'
b'Radio Buttons'
b'Use title case for headings and sentence case for button fields.'
b'Related articles'
b'Linked articles should appear in a logical order, following the step down/step up rule: The first article should be a step down in complexity from the current article. The second one should be a step up in complexity to a more advanced article.'
b'Titles'
b'Titles organize pages and guide readers. A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows.'
b'Titles are (you guessed it) in title case.'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question.'
b'UIC Specific Terms'
b'Use these terms with caution. Be specific on first reference so that users know meaning when abbreviations or terms are used in subsequent text.'
