b'Account theft audit'
b'\nSecuring your email account is incredibly important. What are the\nchances that sensitive information are stored in the email account you\nuse every day? If you were to lose your phone, leave your computer logged in,\nor have your account hacked, the possible harm might extend far further than you\nexpect.'
b"Our account theft audit tool can help you\nget a handle on just how much a cybercriminal could access were they to take over\nyour email account. This tool will scan your account and give you a visualization\nof how many of your accounts hackers could take over if they got access to your\nemail account. The list might surprise you!\nCleartext password audit\nPasswords are the primary authentication mechanism in use on the web.\nYour email account, social networking account, online banking\naccount, and no doubt several others all rely on a password to\nallow you access. Combined with the fact that people tend to re-use\npasswords, emails like this become a severe security risk:\n\nYour new blog has been successfully set up.\nYou can log in with the following information:\nUsername: chrisk\nPassword: hunter3\n\nAs part of an academic study that investigates the intersection between\nsecurity and long-term cloud-based data storage, we have developed a tool\nto help users identify and redact private information. By using this tool,\nyou can preserve the useful but non-sensitive text of an email like that\npictured above while removing the private information. After using\nour tool, the same email will still be in your archive, but will\nhave been modified to appear like the one below. We'll give you a\ncode to print and store in a safe place just in case you need to\nrecover that information in the future.\n\nYour new blog has been successfully set up.\nYou can log in with the following information:\nUsername: chrisk\nPassword: [wImYDaM5DBJZqgLrSYekjQ== ZmwDVbzid7+7LQ6R3uDj+xPnDt1nuxEFDJTxhKPh5T0=]\n\nThis process protects you as a user in the case of an\nattacker who gains access to your account, an attacker who can eavesdrop on\nyour Internet session while reading email, or even someone who borrows your\nlaptop while you aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking and starts digging around.\nUsing these tools should take between three and 30 minutes. The tool will\nrequest access to your email account, and then present to you what we\nthink are private pieces of information that you might not want to keep\naround in your email account (like the example above). We will then allow\nyou to either encrypt or permanently remove all plaintext passwords stored\nin your account, making it more safe in the event of an account\ncompromise. We are collecting non-personal data about some\npeoples' use of this tool as part of our research project. You may\nbe asked to participate in this study. If you consent to\nparticipate in the study, we will only collect non-personal\ninformation about the amount and type of information found and\nredacted, and NEVER keep any of your personally identifiable\ninformation.\n"
