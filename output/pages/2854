b'Welcome to the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford. We are the only basic sciences department at the Rockford campus of the College of Medicine.'
b'Rockford is situated about 75 miles from Chicago downtown and about 70 miles from Madison, Wisconsin. Rockford city is evolving as the sport hub of Midwest with several gardens, museums, and parks. \xe2\x80\x8b The goal of the Department of Biomedical Sciences is to advance the knowledge of living systems with a focus on understanding specific disease processes, discovering the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for disease development, and finding a cure for specific disease conditions.'
b'Today, we are experiencing an explosion of discoveries in biomedical sciences, regenerative medicine, disability research and biotechnology. The range of new information is exciting, and at times, overwhelming. It is our aim in biomedical education, to help students understand this complex information and appreciate the need to become lifelong learners and contributors to an expanding body of knowledge.'
b'The department has a dynamic group of junior and senior faculty and postdoctoral fellows. The research focus of department faculty are in the broad areas of lung cancer biology, lung cancer diagnosis, prostate cancer therapy, stem cells and regenerative medicine, tribocorrosion and devising newer medical implants, immunological regulation of autoimmune diseases, drug discovery and vaccine development. NIH funded projects focus on both basic and translational research.'
b'The department runs a highly successful master\xe2\x80\x99s degree program in Medical Biotechnology with current enrollment of over 60 students. In addition, the department also offers summer internship programs for high school students in partnership with Thermo Fisher Scientific and offers summer internship for college students (SMaRT program).'
