b'UIC\xe2\x80\x99s Energy Resources Center (ERC) won two major grants this year that will help continue its programs in energy research and public service. From the U.S. Department of Energy, the center won a\xc2\xa0$4.2 million grant to continue advancing combined heat and power systems at universities, hospitals, industrial plants, and other organizations across the Midwest. The center also won a\xc2\xa0$3.1 million\xc2\xa0grant from ComEd to provide energy-saving kits to 35,000 eligible individuals and families. In addition to these programs, the ERC is leading the development of a new\xc2\xa0conservation agreement\xc2\xa0to help preserve and restore the monarch butterfly\xe2\x80\x99s habitat.'

b'Students create an app to help epilepsy patients'
b'UIC Engineering students and recent alumnus Himanshu Anand (MS \xe2\x80\x9917) helped develop an\xc2\xa0app\xc2\xa0for patients who have epilepsy. The app is part of a customized, self-management education program to help patients learn about a disease with two major roadblocks: lack of accessibility and information overload. Among its features are learning modules and a seizure diary, which researchers hope will improve patients\xe2\x80\x99 symptom management and knowledge of the disease.'

b'Civil and Materials Engineering Assistant Professor Sean Vitousek\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0study\xc2\xa0on sea-level rise became the first study to analyze sea-level rise due to storm surges and waves on a global scale. Vitousek\xe2\x80\x99s research, featured in\xc2\xa0The Guardian, reveals that the world\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable areas, like small Pacific islands, will experience double the frequency of severe coastal flooding within the next decade. Vitousek also produced a related\xc2\xa0study\xc2\xa0on Southern California\xe2\x80\x99s coast featured in\xc2\xa0The Washington Post that predicts the region\xe2\x80\x99s erosion rates observed between 1930 and 2010 will double by 2100.'

Wildbook, which uses an AI-based, pattern-recognition software to sort pictures of animals crowd-sourced from the web, enables researchers to tell individual animals apart and gain a better understanding of population sizes, both of which could help in the conservation efforts of endangered species.'

b'Professor designs new lithium-air battery'
b'In partnership with Argonne National Laboratories, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Assistant Professor Amin Salehi-Khojin created a new\xc2\xa0lithium-air battery\xc2\xa0with a unique design that prevents the production of lithium-anode oxidation and byproducts that coat the battery\xe2\x80\x99s cathode, which allows the battery to work in a natural air environment. Its achievements in efficiency and cycle life represent a revolution in the battery community, achieving a step toward what researchers call \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond lithium-ion\xe2\x80\x9d batteries. The team\xe2\x80\x99s findings are reported in the journal\xc2\xa0Nature.'
