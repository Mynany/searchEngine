b'The major mission of the Summer Science Internship Program\xc2\xa0is to motivate area high school students to consider careers in science. Understanding what is involved in medical research, how the research can make an impact in new discoveries that help cure diseases\xc2\xa0or discovering\xc2\xa0the impact of industrial science where novel innovations and products are developed can help\xc2\xa0students\xc2\xa0decide if\xc2\xa0a science career is challenging enough for them to want to pursue it.'
b'The\xc2\xa0Summer Science Internship Program offered through the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the College of Medicine Rockford is a long-standing collaborative undertaking between the Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce\xc2\xa0Protein Biology of Rockford and the College of Medicine Rockford to serve the students in the Rockford School District and nearby communities. The program has been going on for over 32 years and aims at imparting new laboratory skills to the selected students. Research laboratories at the UIC Health Sciences Campus-Rockford\xc2\xa0conduct cutting-edge research to find a cure for cancer, develop vaccines, and design and develop new drugs.'
b'Another major mission of this program is to provide invaluable experiences to the students by working side-by-side with leading scientists in the field at the University of Illinois. One of the great experiences the students learn is to work as part of a research team. During this process, the students develop a mentor relationship that often goes well beyond the summer internship. Mentors often guide\xc2\xa0students on\xc2\xa0 college admissions\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0career interviews as well as\xc2\xa0write letters of reference.'
b'Each year the program receives approximately 40 applications from the area high school students for the five (5) internship positions available. The students receive various career-building training such as preparation of resume, interviewing skills, oral and poster presentation skills, leadership skills and ability to work as a team all during the two months of internship training. Each student is paid a stipend sponsored by Thermo Fisher Scientific.'
b'The University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford and Thermo Fisher Scientific Summer Science Internship is an opportunity for local high school students to interact closely with professionals in either an academic or industrial research environment.\xc2\xa0 Students who are selected for the eight-week program gain valuable hands-on laboratory skills using a variety of scientific techniques.'
b'Both Thermo Fisher Scientific and the College of Medicine provide the ideal environments and opportunities for performing research in today\xe2\x80\x99s exciting biotechnology and medical industries.'
