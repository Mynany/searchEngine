b'\xe2\x80\x93 ABSTRACT \xe2\x80\x93'
b'This project is about acquiring a much-in-demand Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based instrument, to develop a Service Instrument for Deep Learning and Visualization\xc2\xa0called \xe2\x80\x9cCOMPaaS DLV: COMposable Platform\xe2\x80\x9d. The project aims to complement available campus computing resources via the campus\xe2\x80\x99s research network. It will be able to\xc2\xa0access local and remote computing and storage facilities funded, including XSEDE, Blue Waters, Deep Learning Instrument and Chameleon. This critical instrumentation will\xc2\xa0provide a platform to pursue fundamental science and engineering research training in deep learning (data mining and data analytics, computer vision, natural language\xc2\xa0processing, artificial intelligence), visualization (simulation, rendering, visual analytics, video steaming, image processing), and a combination of deep learning and\xc2\xa0visualization (e.g., when data is so large that it cannot be easily visualized, then deep learning is used to extract features of interest to be visualized). The instrumentation\xc2\xa0also enables investigation and contribution to societal issues in disciplines such as anthropology, biology, cybersecurity, data-literacy, fraud detection, healthcare,\xc2\xa0manufacturing, urban sustainability, and cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous cars).'
b'Its design utilizes state-of-the-art computer architecture, known as composable architecture, in which the computer\xe2\x80\x99s components (traditional processor, GPU, storage, and\xc2\xa0networking) form a fluid pool of resources, such that different applications with different workflows can be run simultaneously, with each configuring the resources it requires\xc2\xa0almost instantaneously, at any time. Given composable infrastructure scalability and agility, it is more beneficial than traditional clouds and clusters that are rigid,\xc2\xa0overprovisioned, and expensive.'
