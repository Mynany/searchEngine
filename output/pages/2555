b'UIC Web Strategy & Standards'
b'(Updated 11/28/18)'
b'Overview'
b'UIC is dedicated to upholding a uniform strategy and standards for the creation, delivery and maintenance of the Red WordPress multisite theme and functions, as well as an individual websites\xe2\x80\x99 content on the multisite. This is a living document based on the values of UIC and best practices for the creation and delivery of information on the web that will change as UIC explores new services, systems and strategies.'
b'Look for more information on generating content within the Red WordPress multisite?'
b'A companion UIC Web Content Style Guide can be found here.\xc2\xa0 This style guide provides a navigation map on content creation and maintenance, writing for the web and other best practices for web elements.'

b'\n      UIC Web Content Style Guide\n    '
b'Values of the UIC Web Presence'
b'Focus on the user'
b'User needs drive all of the content and services that make up the web presence. All web content and services are regularly assessed through user testing and use data. Areas of the web presence that do not meet the standards of our users are retired or improved.'
b'Inclusion'
b'The web presence respects and builds upon the varied skills, backgrounds and experiences of its diverse users through inclusive language and services. The tone of all web content should be friendly and easily understandable to a diverse audience.'
b'Fairness for all'
b'The web presence works to ensure equal access to information by providing services that meet or exceed standards for accessibility and usability.'
b'Investigative methods'
b'The web presence operates on evidence-based best practices through both original research with our users and external sources (e.g.,Nielsen Norman group articles).'
b'Nielsen Norman group articles'
b'Creative Ingenuity'
b'The web presence employs innovative new services and information practices that improve the online delivery of UIC resources and services to our users.'
b'Public Feedback'
b'The web presence consists of services that engage with users and collaborators in the University, in Chicago and with communities throughout the State, the Midwest region and beyond.'
b'Securing User Data - GDPR Compliance'
b'The web presence protects and upholds the University\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to maintain the privacy of users of University websites.'
b'All sites on the Red Network are GDPR compliant, with a floating cookie notification banner that automatically appears on the bottom of the page.'
b'Goals of the UIC Web Presence'
b'The UIC web presence should provide:'
b'Audiences'
b'The audiences we serve include:'
b'Content Design Principles'
b'Web content is not the same as print content. Web content is much more than copy\xe2\x80\x94it also includes images, media, interactive elements, structural and navigational elements, and metadata. We design, iteratively test and improve our web content based on best practices and web standards.'
b'Useful'
b'Good content design always starts with user needs. Every piece of content (and every system and service) should exist based on an end-user persona and a valid, actionable user need.'
b'Personas are an archetype for a broad user group. Every piece of content should identify one user persona who represents their primary audience. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone\xe2\x80\x9d = \xe2\x80\x9cno one.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A valid user need does not assume a solution or a tool. First identify the need, then design a solution based on that need. User needs are based on evidence from analytics or user research.'
b'User needs also must be based on actions or tasks, following this template: As a [persona], I need to [actionable task], so I can [desired outcome].'
b'Good example: As an undergraduate student (persona), I need to find my academic program requirements (task), so I can complete my degree in four years (desired outcome).'
b'Bad example: As an undergraduate student, I need to use the course catalog (tool assumed), so I know what courses you have (not actionable).'
b'Usable'
b'Content should be easy to read and easy to use, following best practices for web writing and formatting. Usable interfaces only work if they contain usable content.'
b'Language should not exceed an 8th-grade reading level and should be free of jargon and unclear acronyms. In our diverse campuses, it is especially important to use plain language, as many of our students do not speak English as their first language.'
b'Every piece of content should clearly and concisely convey what the user needs to do to meet their need. Even informational content should clearly indicate what the user can \xe2\x80\x9cdo\xe2\x80\x9d with the information.'
b'Accurate'
b'Content that is infrequently maintained will become inaccurate. We regularly review our content to ensure that it is timely and correct.'
b'Accessible'
b'Our services should not exclude any user based on ability. We create web content that meets accessibility standards and considers all user needs.'
b'Web content should meet Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) standards.'
b'Web Content Accessibility Guidelines'
b'Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act'
b'HTML is more accessible than embedded documents. When documents are absolutely necessary, use an accessible PDF format.'
b'accessible PDF format'
b'When writing content about our services, use inclusive language and consider user needs based on ability. For example, if writing about visiting a classroom location, include relevant information about accessible transit options, accessible parking and elevators.'
b'Findable'
b'Our content and services should be findable, on our website and across the Web.'
b'Put the right content in the right web property and deliver it when it\xe2\x80\x99s most useful to our users.'
b'Content should live \xe2\x80\x93 and be maintained \xe2\x80\x93 in one place and shared across all of our platforms. This ensures that information is consistent.'
b'Example: Approved course descriptions appear in the course catalog. Do not recreate content on individual sites which can become out-of-sync; link to original source.'
b'Consistent labels that use plain language will help users find content on our site, in search engines and at times, in our physical spaces.'
b'Using appropriate formatting and web elements, such as headings and bullets, will help users easily scan content on our site, and search engines will be able identify important pieces of information.'
b'Governance'
b'Design and content strategy cannot succeed without a governance structure that ensures the web presence is meeting goals and standards.'
b'Governance Principles'
b'All UIC faculty, staff and students are stakeholders in UIC\xe2\x80\x99s web presence and are encouraged to share feedback and participate in usability testing and design activities. The following departments and committees are responsible for design, content, functionality and usability assessment efforts for the UIC web presence.'
b'The UIC Office of Digital Communications oversees adherence to brand, accessibility and usability standards; coordinates, approves and facilitates development on the code base; and manages creation and deployment of websites on the RED WordPress multisite. The office also provides user support and training.'
b'RED'
b'ACCC provides and maintains the systems and support for the hosting, user management and integrations with other UIC systems of the RED WordPress multisite.'
b'The UIC Office of Marketing and Brand Management sets the branding guidelines for the University. All primary web properties must conform to these guidelines, and secondary properties should conform whenever possible.'
b'The Web Advisory Committee is comprised of representatives from all UIC colleges and vice chancellor offices to inform and recommend enhancements and improvements to the design and function of the RED WordPress multisite based on the needs of site users and content creators.'
