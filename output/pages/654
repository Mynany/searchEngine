b"The official transcript is the University's statement of a student's academic record issued by the Office of the Registrar. It lists all courses completed and grades earned in chronological order by term. Transcripts also contain notations of distinctions, transfer coursework summary, academic status, administrative actions and degrees received."
b"Immediately after a term's final exams have ended, transcripts listing final grades may not be available for a period of up to two weeks. Transcripts listing final degree awarded may not be available for a period of four to six weeks following final exams of the final term in which the degree is earned. Transcripts will not be released if there is a hold on the student's record."
