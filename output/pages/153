b'We understand that from the viewpoint of many countries, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctranscript\xe2\x80\x9d is an American term. When the Office of Admissions asks you for transcripts, we are actually asking for a copy of your academic record which includes courses taken, course descriptions, credits earned or hours completed, and posted grades. The following academic records are always acceptable as \xe2\x80\x9ctranscripts\xe2\x80\x9d:'
b'Some institutions (such as those in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka)\xc2\xa0provide a separate sheet for each year or semester which details the classes taken and marks achieved by a student. The following criteria are applied when the Office of Admissions reviews these credentials:'
b'The Office of Admissions requires proof of all degrees that a student has earned. This should be a copy of your diploma or degree award certificate. It should state the type of degree you were awarded, the fact that it was granted to you, and the date of conferment. See below for information on types of certificates accepted as proof of degree.'
b'The Office of Admissions requires literal, certified translations for all documents issued in a language other than English.\xc2\xa0'
b'\xc2\xa0When not officially\xc2\xa0provided by your prior university, we accept translations from the following:'
b'ATA certified translators'
b'Translations should be on a translator\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead and should be literal (not an interpretation or a paraphrasing).'
b'Plain translations, notarized translations, and translations done by someone other than a certified translator are not acceptable. Evaluations performed by agencies such as WES and ECE will not be used in place of certified translations.'
b'The supplement provides a description of the nature, level, context and status of the studies a student pursued and successfully completed.'
b"Applicants may be required to submit a syllabus or course descriptions if an academic credential does not provide enough detail about the courses taken. These items will usually provide a key for understanding the courses you have taken and will provide the highlights of that course's curriculum. These will be requested on a case-by-case basis."
b'English Proficiency'
b'Valid English proficiency test scores must be submitted if required, based on the country or territory in which an applicant previously studied.\xc2\xa0Refer to the requirements for your country/territory above.'
b'The following are the only tests accepted at UIC as evidence of English proficiency. The Graduate College minimum scores* are indicated for each.'

b'PTE Academic'
b'TOEFL PBT'
b"*Note that departments\xc2\xa0may set higher minimums for consideration of admission to certain programs. Please refer to the program's requirements for additional information."
b'Applicants with scores below the published minimums are not automatically denied. If recommended for admission by the program, these cases are referred to the Graduate College for additional approval.'
b'English proficiency test scores are considered valid for two years following\xc2\xa0the test date and must be valid at the time of application.'
b'*Note that it can take up to two weeks from the process/ship date for reported scores to be reflected as received within our application system.'
b'The English proficiency test requirement may be waived under the following circumstances:'
b'English proficiency requirements are\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0waived based upon the medium of instruction at a previously attended institution. This includes attendance at a branch or campus of a US or UK institution which is physically located in a country or territory from which an English proficiency test is required.'
b'In certain cases where an applicant presents a strong academic profile but has sub-standard English proficiency test scores, the admitting program can offer the opportunity to enroll in an intensive English program prior to beginning study in the degree program. This is known as the Tutorium in Intensive English program (TIE). Note that this option is offered at the discretion of the admitting program. Programs may choose not to offer\xc2\xa0admission to the TIE.'
b'Applicants must still follow the standard application procedure and submit all requirements, including valid English proficiency test scores.\xc2\xa0UIC does not offer the option to defer submission of valid English proficiency test scores.'
b'The\xc2\xa0Tutorium in Intensive English (TIE)\xc2\xa0coordinates UIC\xe2\x80\x99s intensive English instruction. Students enrolled in only intensive English instruction pay UIC\xc2\xa0fees and assessments\xc2\xa0for campus services and\xc2\xa0TIE tuition. As students transition to UIC standard instruction, students pay UIC tuition proportionate to the credit hours taken in standard UIC classes.'
