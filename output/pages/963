b'UIC ALERT procedures to test emergency operations and notification procedures'
b'Uncategorized'
b'On Wednesday, September 27, at 8:20 a.m., UIC initiated an unannounced UIC ALERT test to all faculty, staff and student email addresses. A text message, or SMS, was also sent to those people who have elected to register their mobile phone number.  UIC ALERT messages were also posted to UIC Twitter and Facebook accounts, www.uic.edu,  www.emergency.uic.edu, and on some UIC college and department websites.   Delivering timely, consistent, and accurate information is critical should conditions develop on or near the university that pose a threat of imminent danger. The UIC ALERT emergency notification system uses multiple communications methods to alert the campus community to critical life-safety situations, to advise self-protection from imminent threats, and to inform the community of other conditions regarding the operation of the campus.   You are strongly encouraged to sign up for UIC ALERT by visiting uic-alert.accc.uic.edu. You do not need to re-enroll each year and you can add up to three (3) numbers to receive notifications.  The Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services: Office of Preparedness and Response encourages students, faculty and staff to take actions to become more involved in preparing themselves and their communities. Everyone can play a role in planning for the unexpected.   For more information on UIC Ready and on how to prepare and respond to emergency situations that may arise while on campus, visit www.ready.uic.edu/emergency_guide.  '
