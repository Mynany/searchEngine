b'Research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at UIC focuses on semantics, and discourse and dialogue processing. Our goal is to use NLP to support both education and instruction, and collaboration between human or artificial agents.\xc2\xa0We focus on NLP with a purpose: interfaces and models whose core is NLP technology and that have the potential of positively affecting society. We focus on three main strands of research: a. NL interfaces for educational technology; b. summarization, including for health applications; c. multimodal communication, including human-robot interaction and conversational interfaces for visualization.'

b'Here are some exciting things happening in the UIC NLP Lab!'
b"Dr. Rachel Harsley, alumna of the NLP Lab, continues her success story by being named one of Crain's Tech 50 of 2018."
b'"After becoming the first black woman to receive a doctorate in computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2017, Harsley joined Google as a coder. Before that, she built a messaging app that won the UIC Startup Challenge. The St. Louis native, whose research focused on natural language processing and machine learning, interned at Intel, GE and AT&T before joining Google."'

b'Prof. Barbara Di Eugenio is co-Principal Investigator on a new NSF award that will support the lab work on human-robot interaction. The award is\xc2\xa0 titled "An Interaction Manager for Language and Force Exchanges in Human-Robot Physical Collaboration", and the PI is Prof Milo\xc5\xa1 Zefran, of ECE (UIC). The grant started on Aug 1, 2017 and will last three years.'
b'Abstract: This  project will develop a computational and data-driven framework for a  robot assistant to collaborate with humans in everyday tasks that  involve physical interaction, such as handing over or moving an object  together. Using models learned from observing humans perform such tasks,  the robot will engage in back-and-forth communication, where turns can  be both spoken utterances and force exchanges. Robots that can  collaborate to perform physical tasks could provide assistance in a  variety of settings, such as performing household chores, supporting the  elderly to remain independent, and assisting human workers on the  factory floor.'
b'The  transformative idea of the proposal is to generalize the methodology of  dialog processing to include physical interaction. The fundamental  challenge is how to bridge the gap between the symbolic processing of  language and the low-level control of force exchanges. The concept of  interaction primitives (IPs) is introduced to model physical  interactions. Further, a planning and execution framework in the form of  an interaction manager is proposed. The proposed interaction manager  broadens the traditional dialogue modeling paradigm so that information  can flow from more abstract to lower levels, and vice versa: language  affects physical interaction, and physical interaction affects what is  said. To build the interaction manager, a targeted data collection where  humans perform tasks of interest will be performed. Since physical  interaction data is invariably sparse, statistical learning on the data  will be complemented by model-based generalizations, allowing robots to  collaborate with humans in highly variable and unstructured  environments. The research will inform new course development, and  involve several undergraduate and graduate students.'
