b'WELCOME FROM THE HEAD'
b' Welcome to the website for the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The Department offers a powerful curriculum that trains students to study, design and implement efficient, sustainable, and economic processes at scales ranging from nano-scale to macro-scale. Our award-winning and experienced faculty perform state-of-the-art research, employ advanced teaching methodologies and conduct professional service activities with students, while providing an engaging learning experience. Chemical engineering graduates become experts in engineering processes, design principles and cutting-edge research. '
b'The department facilitates active student engagement with industry recruiters, educators, and alumni. Our graduates are in high demand (making high salaries) as they design and implement a wide range of industrial processes including conversion of crude oil to petrochemicals, production of pharmaceuticals, generation of energy, development of environmentally benign technologies, fabrication of semiconductor wafers for computers, extraction of oil, processing food, designing medical operations, making plastic bottles, brewing quality beer, producing strong cement for buildings, and building smooth surface of cellphones (plus many more). These processes may be classified into one or more of the following categories: biological, chemical, environmental, thermodynamic, interfacial, kinetic, fluidic, electronic, optical, semiconductor fabrication or quantum mechanical.'

b'This year, the department is home to 290 undergraduate students, 69 graduate students and 13 faculty members (including 5 NSF-CAREER Awardees). These are exciting times for the department, which is undergoing tremendous growth. The CHE faculty extends a warm invitation to you to come visit the department.'
b'MISSION OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING'
b'The mission of the Department of Chemical Engineering is to serve society through excellence in education, research, and public service. We provide for our students an education in chemical engineering, and we aspire to instill in them the attitudes, values, and vision that will prepare them for lifetimes of continued learning and leadership in their chosen careers. Through scholarship, the Department strives to generate new knowledge and technology for the benefit of the State of Illinois, the nation, and beyond.'
