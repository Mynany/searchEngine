b'Assessment of Tumor Tissue Micro-structures through Non-Gaussian Diffusion MRI'
b''
b'At a microscopic level, tumor tissues exhibit a high degree of structural heterogeneity and complexity, which reflect the underlying biology. Encoding the diffusion displacement of water molecules, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has the potential to provide quantitative information related to the microstructural changes due to the physiologic and/or pathologic transformations in tissue. Given the heterogeneous nature of biological tissues, particularly the tumors, water diffusion displacement does not follow the classical Gaussian distribution. Recognizing this complexity, several non-Gaussian diffusion models have been suggested to probe the underlying tissue microstructures and environment. Among these, the continuous-time random walk model, its predecessor fractional-order calculus model, and the fractional motion model were developed to examine the spatiotemporal and/or stochastic characteristics of biological tissue through non-Gaussian diffusion dynamics. This talk will present theory, implementation, and validation of these novel non-Gaussian DWI models; and demonstrate their clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment assessment of different types of cancer, such as brain tumor, gastric cancer, and breast cancer.'
