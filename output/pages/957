b'What is Digital Accessibility?'
b'Digital accessibility enables all people, including those with disabilities, to access electronic resources (including web pages, software, mobile devices, e-readers, etc.) and communications. The Digital Accessibility Committee advocates a holistic approach to examining and governing UIC\xe2\x80\x99s web content, services, and technology, with the goal of achieving universal accessibility and usability of digital communications, appropriate use of resources, and compliance with web accessibility standards and regulations.'
b'A goal of the Digital Accessibility Committee is to help the UIC campus continually improve its web accessibility, so that people with disabilities can access web content. Web accessibility also benefits others, including people with changing abilities due to aging. Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.'
