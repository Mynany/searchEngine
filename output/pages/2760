b'Peer Educators'
b'Peer Educators are an important resource for medical students during their pre-clerkship coursework. Peer Educators are M2, M3 & M4 students who were selected through an application process by faculty based on their academic performance and have expressed interest in teaching. Peer Educators conduct review sessions throughout the Phase 1 curriculum and are present during in-class sessions. The Peer Education Program is comprised of General Peer Educators, who focus on Block review materials, and Lab Peer Educators, who provide support in the Anatomy and Pathology Labs.'
