b'Welcome to the Arab American Cultural Center'
b'Ahlan Wasahlan! In the Arab region and its diasporas, people say Ahlan Wasahlan to welcome guests or visitors. The ARABAMCC extends the literal meaning of this phrase to anyone interested in creating awareness about Arab American cultures and histories, building community and solidarity, and promoting social justice and cultural diversity:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cMay you arrive as part of the family and tread easily.\xe2\x80\x9d'
