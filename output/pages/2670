b'On July 23, 2013, the NIH posted a Notice (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-113.html) in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts announcing that NIH encourages grantees to report the use of Individual Development Plans (IDP) for every graduate student and postdoc supported by any NIH grant, regardless of the type of NIH grant that is used for support. NIH encourages implementation by October 1, 2014.'

b'http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-113.html'
b'IDPs are a useful tool to help graduate students and postdocs identify their career goals and to categorize what they need to accomplish to achieve those goals. There is evidence that the IDP process also facilitates communication between faculty mentors and their trainees.'
