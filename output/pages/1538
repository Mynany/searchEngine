b'Jazmin Juarez, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Latin American and Latino Studies and minors in Chinese and international studies, is one of two UIC students awarded scholarships from the Fund for Education Abroad. The fund, which aims to increase study abroad opportunities for U.S. college students underrepresented in international education, will help Juarez study Mandarin Chinese during the Fall 2018 semester at East China Normal University in Shanghai, China.\xc2\xa0After completing her undergraduate studies at UIC in 2021, Juarez plans to pursue graduate studies with a concentration in Chinese international relations.'
b'The Fund for Education Abroad was established as a 501(c)(3) organization in 2010 to provide scholarships and ongoing support to students who are underrepresented among the U.S. study abroad population, particularly first-generation college, minority and community college students.'
