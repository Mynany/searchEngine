b'The\xc2\xa0UIC Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL) received additional funding of $386,418 from the NSF under\xc2\xa0the grant \xe2\x80\x9cSI2-SSI: SAGEnext: Next Generation Integrated Persistent Visualization and Collaboration Services for Global Cyberinfrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The UIC lead on this project is Maxine Brown, director of the Electronic Visualization Lab. The other UIC participants are\xc2\xa0Computer Science Research Associate Professor Luc Renambot, Senior Research Programmer Lance Long, and Associate Professor Andy Johnson, Research Director of the EVL.'
b'This new funding is part of a $527,000 supplement to\xc2\xa0the overall SAGE2 software project, with PI Jason Leigh at University of Hawaii. The supplement brings\xc2\xa0the overall project funding to roughly $5.5 million,\xc2\xa0with roughly 20% at University of Hawaii and 80% at UIC.'
b'The overall project is for the SAGE2 software\xc2\xa0that allows groups to collaborate on large, multi-screen devices such as EVL\xe2\x80\x99s CAVE2. This new supplement is for the research team to consider the cybersecurity of SAGE2, in\xc2\xa0this era when cybersecurity is of such paramount importance.'

b'\xe2\x80\x93 ABSTRACT \xe2\x80\x93'
b'Cyberinfrastructure runs the gamut \xe2\x80\x93 from computing, networks, data stores, instruments, observatories, and sensors, to software and application codes \xe2\x80\x93 and promises to enable research at unprecedented scales, complexity, resolution, and accuracy. However, it is the research community that must make sense of all the data being amassed, so the SAGEnext (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) framework is an innovative user-centered platform that connects people to their data and colleagues, locally and remotely, via tiled display walls, creating a portal, or wide-aperture \xe2\x80\x9cdigital lens,\xe2\x80\x9d with which to view their data and one another. It enables Cyber-Mashups, or the ability to juxtapose and integrate information from multiple sources in a variety of resolutions, as easily as the Web makes access to lower-resolution images today.\xc2\xa0 . . .'
