b'David Segura came to UIC as a freshman with a guaranteed seat in medical school, but in December, he\xe2\x80\x99ll cap his 18-year academic career at UIC with a Ph.D. from the College of Education.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy interests evolved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Segura, recounting the steps he took through his journey at UIC.'
b'A high-achieving student, Segura was on track to become a doctor when he took an honors seminar focused on education. After realizing that it piqued his interest, he had a decision to make.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just felt that education was more of a direct way to affect people\xe2\x80\x99s lives,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Segura, who joined UIC in 2000, graduated with his bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in biology and chemistry in 2004. After, he chose to teach science at a Chicago Public School, the Greater Lawndale High School for Social Justice. He taught there for eight years while pursuing a first master\xe2\x80\x99s in curriculum and instruction (\xe2\x80\x9907), then a second master\xe2\x80\x99s in measurement, evaluation, statistics and Assessment (\xe2\x80\x9913).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTeaching is great, wonderful and I miss it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also very constrained in what you could do,\xe2\x80\x9d Segura said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I graduated, I started a doctoral program because [a mentor] really got me thinking that by being a professor or academic, I could make a larger impact.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'So, Segura completed a Ph.D. in policy studies in urban education. His doctoral dissertation, which he defended over the summer, focused on how students use social capital to persist in science majors. His research interests now are on identity development and persistence of underrepresented students in the STEM field.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the goal for the next couple of years,\xe2\x80\x9d Segura said, \xe2\x80\x9cgetting my research going.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Meanwhile, he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on his new role as an assistant professor of education and youth studies at Beloit College, a private liberal arts college in Wisconsin.'
b'The achievement speaks volumes for Segura, especially because he\xe2\x80\x99s a first-generation Latino graduate. His father\xe2\x80\x99s education stopped after third grade.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s real,\xe2\x80\x9d Segura said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in my office sometimes and I think about my parents, how we grew up poor. My dad retired working at a hotel kitchen. My mom is a mental health tech. I know my parents are just over-the-world proud, and I just think about how fortunate I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to make it to this point.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been no easy feat.'
b'Segura has juggled jobs, research and school for his dream. But his new gig is already paying off.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been [at Beloit] for weeks and I have students come up to me and say, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a Latinx professor,\xe2\x80\x99 and it\xe2\x80\x99s just a big deal for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Segura said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me realize how much there is left to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'
