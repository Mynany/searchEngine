b'With no network suits or pestering TMZ journalists lurking, comedian Leslie Jones told the UIC community she felt free during her \xe2\x80\x9cLOL@UIC\xe2\x80\x9d performance Jan. 26.'
b'Jones, a \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d cast member and writer, demonstrated that liberation with an hour-long stand-up routine that featured everything from a hilariously uncomfortable Prince encounter to playing matchmaker with students. The result: a memorable show that had the crowd rolling.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe highlight of the show in my opinion was just hearing all the laughter throughout,\xe2\x80\x9d event lead Sunil Dommaraju said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was refreshing to hear such a loud roar every time a great joke was made.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cLOL@UIC,\xe2\x80\x9d presented by UIC\xe2\x80\x99s Student Activities Board, offered students, faculty and staff an opportunity to see first-rate comedy for free. They took advantage by packing the UIC Forum to see a smoothly run presentation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it went really well,\xe2\x80\x9d Dommaraju said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe show started on time. The artists transitioned nicely. The show was hilarious. A lot of people came to the event as well, which is always great.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Jones received the loudest chuckles when talking about her own promiscuous lifestyle and venturing into the crowd to tease certain audience members. It was all in good spirit, as the 49-year-old comedian seemed genuinely elated to return to stand-up comedy.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a doubt, my favorite part of the event was when Leslie Jones came down from the stage and started walking through the crowd and interacting with UIC students,\xe2\x80\x9d said Almasa Pecanin, president of UIC\xe2\x80\x99s Student Activities Board. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were students standing up from their seats to see who she was speaking to and if it was someone they know. There were also students trying to get Leslie\xe2\x80\x99s attention so they can be the next ones she talked to.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that was so funny, and must have been such a crazy experience for the students who had a chance to interact with her.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The event wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all about Jones, though. Opener Jon Laster did more than just warm up the crowd. Laster questioned the audience on majors, class status and partying habits, then built brilliantly humorous responses off their answers. He also put a unique spin on racial quips, accentuating tendencies of white women to overly rely on their fathers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to laugh as much as I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Pisanski, a senior in computer engineering. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought Jon Laster\xe2\x80\x99s opening act was hilarious, especially his girls and their dads bit.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At the end of the show, Pisanski and other students in attendance left with a wide grin.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was my first time going to LOL,\xe2\x80\x9d Pisanski said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy they were able to organize such a fun and free event for students. Looking back, I wish I went to the ones I missed.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think during difficult times, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to find a positive outlet to release your tension and anxieties,\xe2\x80\x9d Pecanin added. \xe2\x80\x9cLeslie addressed issues in society, college life, and other things in a comedic tone, so students would be able to laugh about them rather than letting them consume their thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d'
