b'Dear Colleagues,'
b'The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is delighted by the campus response to the UIC DPI Seed Funding Program. This funding opportunity, as previously announced, leverages up to $10 million from UIC\xe2\x80\x99s royalty revenue as \xe2\x80\x9cseed funds\xe2\x80\x9d to align new UIC research activities with the DPI mission and priorities. Information on DPI can be found at https://dpi.uillinois.edu/.'

b'Two cycles of funding were announced in October. Due to a strong response to Cycle 1 and a large volume of letter of intent (LOIs) submitted for Cycle 2, we are extending the deadline for Cycle 2 applications.'
b'DPI Seed Funding Cycle 2 proposals will be due no later than 5:00 pm Central Time on Friday, January 18, 2019.'
