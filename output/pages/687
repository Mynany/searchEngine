b'Sexual Misconduct'
b'Introduction'
b'UIC is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and respectful learning, living and working environment for its students, faculty, and staff members. When individuals experience acts of sexual misconduct (i.e. sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence), their sense of safety and trust is violated and this can significantly interfere with their success at the university. Our community expects that all interpersonal relationships and interactions \xe2\x80\x93 especially those of an intimate nature \xe2\x80\x93 are based upon values of mutual respect, dignity, responsibility, open communication, and clear consent.'
b'Responding to incidents of sexual misconduct can be challenging, whether you are the person harmed or someone trying to help. We share the responsibility for creating a safer, more caring campus culture in which bias, harassment, and violence have no place\xe2\x80\x94and every member of our community is free to flourish. The\xc2\xa0Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy\xc2\xa0has been developed to address all types of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, dating violence and domestic violence.'
b'Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy'
b'The university takes all complaints and accusations of sexual misconduct seriously. We welcome your involvement in our mission to foster a campus environment that strives to prevent sexual misconduct and promotes the reporting of sexual misconduct, compassionate responses to survivors of sexual violence, and equitable treatment of student complainants and respondents.'
