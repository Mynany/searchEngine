b'Ana Bedran-Russo is working to make\xc2\xa0tooth decay a thing of the past.'
b'Bedran-Russo is using biology to enhance the properties of the tooth so as\xc2\xa0to halt the progression of decay \xe2\x80\x94 and developing\xc2\xa0new ways to restore teeth using\xc2\xa0materials that are more like the tooth itself. The more natural material will ultimately improve outcomes by reducing the likelihood that the tooth will need to be repaired again.'
b'The chemical compounds she studies \xe2\x80\x93 proanthocyanidins \xe2\x80\x93 are a class of polyphenols derived from plants. These renewable materials\xc2\xa0can be found in seeds, bark and leaves. Bedran-Russo is also experimenting with grape seed, cocoa seed, pine bark and cinnamon bark extracts.'
b'Advances in restorative dentistry\xc2\xa0have implications not only for oral health, but for overall\xc2\xa0well-being. Bedran-Russo\xe2\x80\x99s work will give\xc2\xa0patients treatment options that will help them remain free of dental decay.'
