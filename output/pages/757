b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a chain reaction that occurs when bright minds converge in innovative spaces. '
b'Theories become revolutionary new ways forward. Experts become foremost in their fields. New breakthroughs once far off are suddenly within reach. That\xe2\x80\x99s not all. Faculty illuminate young minds with possibility. Purpose is found. Potential, unleashed. At UIC, we\xe2\x80\x99re cultivating an environment of empowerment for our faculty, and by extension, for Chicago and the world.'
