b'The Rural Medical Education Program'
b'The Rural Medical Education (RMED) program seeks to recruit, admit and prepare medical students from the state of Illinois, who will, upon completion of residency training, locate and practice in rural Illinois.'
b'RMED, a core program of the National Center for Rural Health Professions, offers a community-based rural medical curriculum, extensive clinical experience, a 16-week rural preceptorship, a community-oriented primary care project and interdisciplinary medical training. Since 1993, more than 200 students have participated in the RMED program, 80 percent of whom have chosen primary care residencies. More than 70 percent of program graduates are practicing rural primary care medicine in Illinois.'
b'For more information about the RMED program, please contact the RMED recruitment office at 815.395.5782. For a detailed brochure on the program, please click here.'
