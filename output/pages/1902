b''
b'I am an Assistant Professor in the department of computer science at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).\nMy research interests primarily lie in computer networks, specifically in datacenters and low-latency networks, software-defined networking, and network hardware. I have secondary interests in architecture and hardware design.'
b'I received my Ph.D. from Purdue University in August 2015. I spent the summer and fall of 2012 at Google on datacenter congestion control and load balancing. I worked as a senior design designer at Nvidia between 2004 and 2008 when I designed the memory controller for the first unibody MacBook Air (see this this newspaper clip!). I got my bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree from BITS, Pilani (India).'
