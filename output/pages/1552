b'Types of Aid'
b'Scholarships'
b"A scholarship is gift assistance that does not have to be repaid. Scholarships are awarded based on a student's academic achievement, athletic ability, field of study, special talents, etc."
b'Notify SFAS of All Scholarships'
b'Students must report outside scholarships so\xc2\xa0SFAS can recalculate aid eligibility. If students have remaining unmet need or have not exceeded their cost of attendance (COA), other awards will not be affected. Once federal need or COA is met, outside assistance may result in the reduction of Federal Work Study, student loans, or other grants and scholarships to remain compliant with federal regulations. If SFAS is notified that a student will receive outside assistance after receiving a refund, they will be 100% responsible for repaying any refund adjustment.'

b'Special Education Teacher Tuition Waiver Program'

SETTW recipients receive a waiver of tuition and all fees excluding the CTA transit fee and Campus Care Insurance (if applicable). Students who receive the waiver must commit to working as a Special Education teacher in the state of Illinois. If the teaching commitment is not fulfilled, students must repay the entire amount plus interest. Applications are due by March 1 for the upcoming year.'
b'Minority Teacher of Illinois'
b'The Minority Teacher of Illinois (MTI) Scholarship Program encourages talented students to pursue careers as teachers at nonprofit Illinois preschool, elementary and secondary schools. The program aims to provide minority children with access to a greater number of positive minority role models. Recipients must agree to begin teaching within one year of graduation at a nonprofit Illinois public, private, or parochial preschool, elementary or secondary school that the Illinois State Board of Education has certified as a school with at least 30% minority students. Applications are due March 1 for the upcoming year.'

b'To be considered for most university scholarships and awards, incoming undergraduate students need only complete the main UIC admission application; no additional steps are necessary. Students interested in the Honors College must complete an additional application for consideration. '
