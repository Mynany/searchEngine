b'Ways to Help to the Medical Evaluation Response Initiative Team (MERIT)'
b'You can support MERIT\xe2\x80\x98s work in helping\xc2\xa0abused and neglected children in a variety of ways, including:'
b'MERIT'
b'Give to the Medical Evaluation Response Initiative Team (MERIT) Program Fund '
b'The Medical Evaluation Response Initiative Team (MERIT) Program Fund provides unrestricted support and allows us to continue our mission on behalf of abused and neglected children in Northern Illinois.\xc2\xa0Because government grants do not typically cover all of the costs of providing the services these children need, gifts to the MERIT Program Fund help us to provide\xc2\xa0multiple evaluations, treatment and advocacy services to children suspected of being abused or neglected.'
b'Give now to the Medical Evaluation Response Initiative Team (MERIT) Fund through the College of Medicine Rockford\xc2\xa0giving page.\xc2\xa0'
b'giving page.'
b'Buy From the Amazon Wish List'
b'The MERIT Amazon Wish List is a great way to directly help the children that we serve. Through the Amazon.com wish list, individuals can select and purchase items that will be delivered to MERIT and distributed directly to the children and families that need our support most.'
