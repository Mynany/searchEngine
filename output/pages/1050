b'GUARANTEED PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM ADMISSIONS'
b'The GPPA initiative allows a limited number of first year students per year to be admitted to UIC with guaranteed admission to one of several graduate or professional degree programs. Students follow a specific curriculum and meet established performance criteria to maintain their admission guarantee.'
b'With the security of GPPA, students are able to focus on undergraduate studies and have the freedom to pursue many subject areas and disciplines. In addition, participants have early and frequent contact with professional school faculty and advisors. Most students in GPPA also benefit from the facilities and services of the UIC Honors College.'
