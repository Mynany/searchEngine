b'His hard work over the weekend paid off as he and his team were awarded two prizes: 3rd place overall and an award for addressing a Problem Statement through the MIT Office of Sustainability.'
b'Soni was the lone UIC representative at the hackathon, teaming up with students from Stanford, Northeastern and North Carolina State University to form their team MassSave.\xc2\xa0Soni\xe2\x80\x99s team developed a\xc2\xa0Building Management System (BMS) to hack MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Smart Sensor using a\xc2\xa0Machine Learning model and a\xc2\xa0Deep Reinforcement Learning model.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great experience to participate, trying to solve the most challenging problems that companies are facing in the industry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Soni.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cA big shout-out to my team MassSave involving these amazing people I worked with and without whom it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been possible!\xe2\x80\x9d'
