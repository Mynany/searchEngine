b'What is our Club? '
b"\r\n                    Our Club is an opportunity for engaging with colleagues in a context of curiosity, uncertainty, and depth. Come explore interesting and unpredictable topics that stretch your horizons! It is a place for anyone in the UIC community to explore ideas and research that interests them. Journal Club effectively invites our community to say,  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I am reading, this is what I am interested in, and/or this is what I am thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d  We meet to discuss the various leadership journal articles or books we are reading and compare what we're each learning. (You choose your article--everyone is reading something different!) There are amazing transdisciplinary themes that thread through each book or article.\r\n                     YOU DON'T NEED TO PRESENT ANYTHING....JUST COME, LISTEN, AND ENJOY THE DISCUSSION!! \n\n\n\n\n"
