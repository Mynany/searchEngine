b'Lactation Rooms'
b"In accordance with Section 4207 of the Affordable Care Act, an employer shall provide reasonable break time to an employee who needs to express breast milk for her infant child for up to one year after the child's birth. An employer shall provide a private space, other than a bathroom, where an employee can express her milk on an as needed basis."
b'Below is a list of designated lactation rooms at UIC. There are many more areas that are informally designated as lactation rooms. Representatives in the colleges and administrative units accommodate the needs of nursing mothers at a decentralized level, therefore, please check your department representative to secure space.'

b'Compensation'
b'Nursing mothers shall be paid for break time needed for nursing or expressing milk. The break time may run concurrently with any break time already established. Nursing mothers are also entitled to a reasonable number of additional paid breaks to allow to them to nurse or express milk. Departments shall provide reasonable break time as needed by the employee unless doing so would create an undue hardship as defined by the Illinois Human Rights Act. Supervisors are asked to contact their university or system human resources office before denying an employee a paid break for expressing milk based on the undue hardship exclusion.
