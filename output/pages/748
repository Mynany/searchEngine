b'As engaged leaders, Ignite Mentors will help guide the leadership explorations of first- and second-year UIC students. The ideal mentor will have some leadership experience and, most importantly, be committed to engaging with leadership on a personal, academic, and professional level. Ignite mentors will gain confidence in their interpersonal, facilitation, and advising skills - all critical areas of need for graduate school and the workforce.'
b'By submitting an application, you are committed to attending every Ignite session on Monday afternoons from 4-6pm starting February 11 and ending April 1.'
b'Unfortunately, due to the nature of a program, class/work/personal conflicts that overlap with our program schedule will not be excused. Please consider applying for the next run of the program in Fall 2019.'
