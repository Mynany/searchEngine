b'UIC DPI Seed Program'
b' DPI Cycle 2 proposals are now due no later than 5:00 pm CST on Friday, January 18, 2019. The submission portal will close promptly at 5:00 pm.'
b'UIC announces a new program to catalyze UIC-led activities in support of the University of Illinois System\xe2\x80\x99s Discovery Partners Institute (DPI). The UIC DPI Seed Program advances the mission of the DPI by investing up to $10 million from UIC\xe2\x80\x99s royalties\xe2\x80\x99 revenue accumulated at the System level to be used as \xe2\x80\x9cseed funds\xe2\x80\x9d for projects that will support the development of DPI. The UIC DPI Seed Program is created to align new UIC activities with the DPI\xe2\x80\x99s priorities and mission. For more information on the DPI, see\xc2\xa0 http://innovation.uillinois.edu/ The Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s Office will be soliciting applications over several cycles targeting the broad areas of big data and cybersecurity; drug discovery and healthcare delivery innovations; and automated vehicles and mobility. Applications in other areas that still meet the review criteria below are also welcome. Projects may consist of research, education and engagement activities, including interdisciplinary collaborations, and should be 6 months to 2 years in duration.'
b'http://innovation.uillinois.edu/'
b'Application budgets should reflect actual needs of the proposed project. Target areas are the same for both cycles; Cycle 1 deadline is to rapidly fund smaller projects of more limited scope, whereas Cycle 2 deadline accommodates larger projects that require more time to prepare. If awarded, Project Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) will be required to submit progress reports every 6 months and a final report at the conclusion of the project period. Templates for submitting progress reports will be distributed to awardees. The Project Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) may submit more than one application for any cycle, provided the objectives of each application are distinctly different. Applications may include multiple Project Directors/Principal Investigators, as long as the individuals have complementary and integrated expertise. The contact Project Director/Principal Investigator must be a UIC faculty member with at least 0.5 FTE appointment at UIC at the time of the application and for the duration of the project period. All funds requested should be expended on UIC activities (i.e., no subcontracts are allowed to other organizations). Unpaid consultants or external contributors are allowed.'
b'The UIC DPI Seed Program intends to fund up to 10 awards per Cycle (10 in Cycle 1, 10 in Cycle 2). However, the actual number of awards funded is contingent upon the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. The Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s office, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, will conduct a review of applications and awards to determine the processes used for future funding cycles.'
b'\n\nEligibility\n\n\nThe contact Project Director/Principal Investigator must be a UIC faculty member with at least a 0.5 FTE appointment at UIC at the time of the application and for the duration of the project period.\nApplications may include multiple Project Directors/Principal Investigators, as long as the individuals have complementary and integrated expertise.\nThe intent of the program is to encourage new UIC activities aligned with DPI\xe2\x80\x99s priorities and mission. Participation by non-UIC personnel should be limited, confined to the role of key personnel, and be well justified. All funds must be expended on UIC activities (i.e., no subcontracts are allowed to other organizations).\nUnpaid consultants or external contributors are allowed.\nProject Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) may submit more than one application for any cycle, provided the objectives of each application are distinctly different.\n\n'

b'\n\nFAQs\n\n\nQ.\nCan we also team up with UIUC or Northwestern/UChicago/IIT? or are we restricted in the University partnership?\nA.\n\nPartnerships are encouraged, but the budget line items must be restricted to UIC only (no subcontracts are allowed).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nCan we also team up with UIUC or Northwestern/UChicago/IIT? or are we restricted in the University partnership?\nA.\nPartnerships are encouraged, but the budget line items must be restricted to UIC only (no subcontracts are allowed).\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIf we want to partner with industry, does it need to be located in the State of Illinois?\nA.\nNo, an industry partner does not have to be located in Illinois.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIs there a restriction on the allocated budget? Can we use it toward student lines, supplies/services, etc.?\nA.\nAllowable expenses are outlined in the guidelines, but all expenses need to be justified to be in line with the project scope and objectives.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nI would like to eventually create a NSF-funded Industry University Collaborative Research Center? Would a proposal to start this effort be a suitable one for this program?\nA.\nMost certainly, as I/UCRC\xe2\x80\x99s are directly aligned with DPI\xe2\x80\x99s mission.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nWould the creation of a class at UIC be a fundable project under this program?\nA.\nCertainly, the seed funding program is to encourage a broad range of ideas. In this specific case, a course that is aligned with the mission of the DPI would be an appropriate proposal.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nDo all the projects need to have activities that have a broad enough scope justifying $100K?\nA.\nNot all projects need to be proposed at $100K. For instance, the course project in the question above could mainly have a PI\xe2\x80\x99s course release time as budget (typically 10-20k).\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nWhat kind of commitment / support would be welcome from an industry partner?\nA.\nMatching funds support indicates a strong commitment to the proposed effort and would be considered a strong commitment.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nDo I need support letters from an industry partner in order to submit a proposal?\nA.\nWhile support letters are desirable and can make a strong proposal, they are by no means required.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nAre the project periods different for Cycles 1 and 2?\nA.\nNo. Both cycles allow a project period of 6 months to 2 years.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nDoes the 7-page limit include references?\nA.\nNo. References may start on a new page and do not count toward the page limit.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIs travel to academic conferences an allowable expense?\nA.\n"Travel to meetings or symposia" is not an allowable expense and would include academic conferences. However, travel for the purpose of "a specific, goal-oriented collaboration that will yield tangible outcomes" is allowed. IF the latter were planned to occur at a conference, it could be justified.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIs the salary limitation per person or for the total budget?\nA.\nIt is per person, i.e., each investigator can budget up to 2 months of salary up to the NIH cap of $189,600.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIs a professor emeritus employed part-time (less than 50%) who still conducts research and advises graduate students eligible to be a PI?\nA.\nNo.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nWill reviewers be internal to UIC or external?\nA.\nAll reviews will be conducted by UIC faculty.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIf a proposal includes proprietary data, will it be held confidential during review?\nA.\nPlease indicate in your proposal if you have proprietary data covered by the terms of a university contract. As with any review, reviewers will be expected to not share privileged information. Reviewers will be notified that some proposals may contain propriety data considered confidential under UIC contracts.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nWhat are the criteria for reviewing proposals?\nA.\n\nThe primary review criteria include the following:\nAcademic merit of the proposed work.\nAlignment of proposed project with DPI priorities. This includes potential for creating jobs and enhancing economic development in Chicago and Illinois. \xc2\xa0Examples of this could include the potential of the project to increase the labor pool (workforce development) in critical areas, and to stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation as well as commercialization of new technologies.\nPotential for long-term impact on UIC\xe2\x80\x99s research, education and/or healthcare activities. \xc2\xa0For example, to what extent does the project expand research capacity, add new programs or services, and improve accessibility or quality of UIC activities.\nPotential for meaningful engagement of private, public, or non-profit partners in the proposed activity.\nSustainability of efforts beyond the project period funded by the UIC DPI Seed Program (e.g., potential for support through subsequent grants or other sources of revenue). \xc2\xa0\nThe review committee will also take into account the following secondary criteria:\nThe strength and organization of the project team\nThe feasibility of the proposed project including: \xc2\xa01) Is the projected timeline feasible and well-justified? 2) Are potential challenges and corresponding solutions discussed?\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nCan additional sections be included for preliminary data or experimental plans?\nA.\nNo. Preliminary data and experimental plans may be included, but they should be incorporated into the other sections as you deem most logically appropriate.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIn the FAQ you mention fringe can be included. Is the money held in a state account? I thought fringe was not charged to state money, or is this not state money?\nA.\nThis money comes from royalites, not state appropriated funds.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nAs an Adjunct If I were to participate in an approved UIC project, am I eligible for up to 2 months of salary & fringe benefits as a paid research assistant or technician?\nA.\nIf you are a paid adjunct at UIC now and maintain a UIC position throughout the project term, you would be eligible to receive salary support for up to two months should the proposal you are part of be selected for funding.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nIs there a preferred format for the budget?\nA.\nThere is no specific template required. You can use the ORS budget template form to help you decide what costs to include and generate a budget page. You will need to edit the template form as needed. The template can be found at this link: http://research.uic.edu/sponsored_programs/preparing-proposal/developing-budget/budget-templates\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nAre clinicians that are part of the Mile Square Health System eligible to apply for this program?\nA.\nAs long as you fulfill the appointment eligibility (UIC Faculty member with at least a 0.5 FTE appointment at the time of application and for the duration of the project period), and plan to expend the funding on UIC activities, you would be eligible. Non-faculty clinical appointments and academic professional appointments are ineligible to be the contact PI.\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nQ.\nHow do I calculate my salary request if my salary is above the NIH cap?\nA.\nYou should make your salary calculation based on the NIH cap and indicate in the justification that the UIC salary is above the cap. You can adjust the effort as you see fit, but the total salary request per person should not exceed $42,133 ($189,600/ 9months *2 months).\n\n'
