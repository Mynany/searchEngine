b'UIC Computer Science students, faculty and staff strike a fun pose with AnitaB.org CEO and President Brenda Darden Wilkerson (Center) at the 2018 Grace Hopper Celebration in Houston'
b'More than 60 Computer Science students, faculty and staff attended the Grace Hopper Celebration in Houston September 26-28.\xc2\xa0 Students were able to attend presentations on a variety of topics, professional development activities, an open source day, and much more during what is billed as the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest gathering of women technologists.'
b''
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing so many girls from the technological field was actually a motivator and relief because we don\xe2\x80\x99t see much of that on campus. The few days spent there was both educational and so inspiring.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Aiswarya Baiju (BS \xe2\x80\x9919)'
b'CS student Aiswarya Baiju presents her research at Grace Hopper'
b''
b'Aiswary Baiju (BS \xe2\x80\x9919) was one of several Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) attendees selected for a technical poster presentation of her research\xc2\xa0on the development of an automated virtual health coaching assistant.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have always been intrigued by Artificial Intelligence and the research project my professor was working on was very interesting and it\xe2\x80\x99s a technology that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist yet. So I knew I wanted to be part of such a project that will expose me to new ideas and help me learn more and put my technical skills to test,\xe2\x80\x9d Baiju said.'
b'Baiju felt her poster made a good impression on the GHC attendees. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were quite fascinated by the project we were working on and wanted to know much more about it and the future steps we will be working on for automation and the system. Some have even decided to follow-up with me after the conference to further discuss about the research and to know more about the previous progress.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Baiju enjoyed her GHC experience. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very enlightening and quite an eye-opening moment for me; it boosted my confidence in both my technical as well as professional skills. Seeing all these women excel in their field and receiving valuable feedback from them and just being around such accomplished individuals who had so much knowledge and advice to share with us, it was just incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Baiju\xe2\x80\x99s advice for other female computer science students: \xe2\x80\x9cI would encourage more people to apply and attend GHC because every second we spent there was so worth it and so inspirational. It\xe2\x80\x99s an experience that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get much of and is worth taking advantage of,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
