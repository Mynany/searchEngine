b'Imagine you are moving a couch with a friend. As you start, you both need to crouch down, securely grab it, and simultaneously lift it up. As you carry it, you may say a word here and there, but that is clearly not enough to coordinate your actions. You mostly communicate through force: you can feel whether to move forward or backward, left or right and it can tell you to raise the couch higher, put it down or to stop moving.'
b'Professor Milo\xc5\xa1 \xc5\xbdefran, of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and Professor Barbara Di Eugenio, of the Department of Computer Science (CS), understand the importance of clear communication while collaborating. Now, they have teamed up to enable robots to communicate and collaborate with people.'
b'The goal of the project is to develop a computational and data-driven framework for a robot to collaborate with humans in everyday tasks that involve physical interaction, such as handing over or moving an object together. Using models learned from observing humans perform these tasks, the robot will engage in back-and-forth communication where both spoken words and forces are exchanged.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a continuation of our research [to assists the elderly], but it\xe2\x80\x99s more specific than before,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc5\xbdefran. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore it was about trying to understand how multiple modalities in communication can be brought together. Now we are focusing on force and speech and trying to understand the back and forth exchanges between collaborators in everyday tasks.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'In natural language processing (NLP), Di Eugenio\xe2\x80\x99s area of expertise, researchers have studied models of dialogue between humans. In these models, it can be determined who the leader is (who has control of the conversation) and who is the follower. Humans know what to do, to become a leader or when to be a follower.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are trying to adapt the approach developed in NLP to inform the robot how to act in collaborative tasks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zefran. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the robot is a participant instead of another human, when should the robot become a leader instead of a follower? The robot, in a sense, has to be programmed to understand all of these things.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe tasks that we are interested in are part of how people collaborate in real life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Di Eugenio. \xe2\x80\x9cLike preparing dinner together, moving furniture together, or passing food at the dinner table. When we execute these collaborative tasks, signals at different levels of abstraction are exchanged: speech is at a high level, while force exchanges are at a lower level. The two combine in such a way that for example, the item we carry together doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall. We are trying to model that coordination.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we are holding something together, the only thing that I can sense from your part is the force you are exerting on the object,\xe2\x80\x9d added \xc5\xbdefran.'
b'There is still a lot of research to be done when interpreting conversation where people are collaborating on physical tasks. The two researchers see these force exchanges as gestures that need to be incorporated to make sense of the entire interaction. Conversation is just the language part, but the whole interaction includes all these signals and one needs to make sense of all of them so, ultimately, the robot can interact in an appropriate way.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always a physical connection \xe2\x80\x93 either direct or through an object,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc5\xbdefran. \xe2\x80\x9cThrough the physical connection you communicate forces. And through these forces I can tell you what to do. If we are moving and I stop the object, you will feel it and you will stop. So I have signaled something to you.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you listen to language on its own or sense forces on their own, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the complete picture,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor example, in language, you may not get the full meaning unless you see what the person is doing. So there\xe2\x80\x99s additional information that helps you understand. We are trying to formalize the way we can inform the meaning of language from force signals. This is something that has not been studied so far. We also want to use language to understand forces. We are putting all of this in one space where there is no distinction between force signal and speech.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In order to collaborate with a person, the robot needs to be smart enough to know whether to do something physically (move an object) or say something (\xe2\x80\x9cwait, you\xe2\x80\x99re moving too fast\xe2\x80\x9d) and there needs to be a smooth transition between the two.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s amazing that people are so good at coordinating, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t even think about it unless something goes wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Di Eugenio. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we move something together or hand something to each other I don\xe2\x80\x99t consciously pay attention to the force I sense on your part so I can safely let the object go. Humans are very good at this. How can we get robots to do the same thing?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is sometimes called embodied intelligence,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc5\xbdefran. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very difficult, because it requires reasoning about the physical world and all the information you have about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s different from using AI algorithms to process data. That\xe2\x80\x99s where we are trying to make some progress.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The research was made possible by a three-year National Science Foundation grant to the two professors for $1,048,618 entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAn Interaction Manager for Language and Force Exchanges in Human-Robot Physical Collaboration.\xe2\x80\x9d '
