b'Tragedy in Las Vegas'
b'The Counseling Center shares in the sadness regarding the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada on Oct. 1, 2017. This tragedy can certainly be difficult for any of our UIC students who are from that area or know of others who are from there or who may have been directly or indirectly impacted. If you are experiencing distress as related to this event, or find yourself having memories of other tragedies triggered by this recent tragedy, please know that the Counseling Center remains available as a safe and confidential space in which to talk with a mental health counselor. Contact us at 312.996.3490 (M-F, 8a.m. \xe2\x80\x93 5p.m.) or call the InTouch Hotline 312.996.5535 (Sunday thru Friday, 6 p.m. \xe2\x80\x93 10:00 p.m.). Taking care of yourself by accessing available support and staying connected with others by offering your support is encouraged.
