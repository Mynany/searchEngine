b'Your help is vital to the Mission of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria (UICOMP), which is to \xe2\x80\x9cLead Collaboration to Improve Health.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For more than 40 years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with our community to train exceptional physicians, provide outstanding patient care and engage in innovative research. UICOMP\xe2\x80\x99s impact is felt locally where 60% of Peoria\xe2\x80\x99s primary care physicians trained in a UICOMP sponsored residency.'
b'Giving is a very personal act. Perhaps your gift remembers a specific department or person that played a key role in your education. Perhaps your gift is to help a student through supporting a scholarship. Perhaps you or a family member are living with cancer and wish to contribute to the research for a cure. And perhaps you will choose to give to an unrestricted fund that provides me or a Department Chair with the flexibility to decide how to use your gift to meet the most acute needs of the college. The following web pages provide a variety of options so you can choose where to place your gift.'
b'Wherever you choose to give, please be assured that your gift is needed, appreciated and will be used to benefit the students and programs of the College of Medicine here in Peoria. Your gifts help us to accomplish great things that improve the health of our communities.'
