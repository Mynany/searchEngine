b'Nicolas Garcia Mills, Philosophy Doctoral Student, 2015'
b'I am a PhD student in the Philosophy Department. My research project focuses on the practical philosophies of Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. During my year at the Goethe-Universit\xc3\xa4t\xc2\xa0Frankfurt on a DAAD research fellowship, I hope to both continue to figure out Hegel\'s criticisms of Kant\'s moral philosophy and also make sense of Hegel\'s appropriation of the Aristotelian concept of habit as a "second nature" as a way of avoiding the Kantian pitfalls.'

b'Georgina Ruff, Art History Doctoral Student, Research Award, 2014'
b'Georgina Ruff is a PhD candidate in Art History, currently writing her dissertation: "Beyond Light and Space: How the Lamp Changes Everything." This study turns the focus from the phenomenological effects of post-war light art to the technological means of the works production, casting a wider net that includes film and performance theories, the techniques of media archaeology, and the considerations of new media to analyze these ephemeral and technological works of installation. She is currently a recipient of the UIC Dean\'s Scholar Award and her research was previously supported by a DAAD Fellowship and a Mellon Fellowship to the NYU Seminar in Technological Art History. See her CV here.'
