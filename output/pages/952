b'What is a UCEDD?'
b'Entities now known as UCEDDs were initially created over four decades ago with the enactment of Public Law 88-164 (1963) to serve people with developmental disabilities. Currently authorized under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (the DD Act), UCEDDs are now a resource for Americans with a wide range of disabilities. They receive their core funding from the Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AIDD) within the Administration for Community Living (ACL), US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).'
b'Each UCEDD is affiliated with a major research university and serves as a resource for all people in the areas of education, research, and service relative to the needs of people with developmental disabilities. Their programs are part of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD), a membership organization that supports and promotes a national network of university-based interdisciplinary programs.'
