The Office of International Services (OIS) supports and enhances this global mission by providing immigration expertise and intercultural programming to UIC\xe2\x80\x99s students, scholars, and academic departments. By giving to OIS, you are investing in UIC's global mission. Your gift will provide OIS with the financial support necessary to sustain critical university functions and explore innovative programming and advocacy for our dynamic international population. Additionally, gifts to the international student scholarship or emergency grant have the power to impact students on a personal level, often in times of great need. OIS is committed to comprehensive campus internationalization at UIC; we are excited to have your support! "
