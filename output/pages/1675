b'Student vs Graduate Assistant'
b'The following is meant to help distinguish a Student Employee appointment from a Grad appointment ."Grad Assistant-Student" is no longer an appropriate title.\xc2\xa0 In legacy systems it was used to distinguish a Student Employee (SA) job held by someone with a Grad Assistantship (GA).\xc2\xa0 However, Banner allows a mix of employee-group jobs, so the title of each job should be distinctive to the e-class.'
