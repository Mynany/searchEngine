b'Eliminating the latent reservoir of HIV'
b'\n\t\t\t\tDecember 6, 2018\t\t\t'
b'A new study suggests that a genetic switch that causes latent HIV inside cells to begin to replicate can be manipulated to completely eradicate the virus from the human body. Cells harboring latent HIV are \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible\xe2\x80\x9d to the natural defenses of the immune system.'
b'The findings, which suggest a cure for HIV may be possible, are reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.'

b'During infection, the DNA of HIV makes its way into the host cell\xe2\x80\x99s nucleus and integrates itself into the host genome. The Tat gene circuit is a key piece of HIV DNA that controls the HIV gene transcription and activation. When activated, it initiates a takeover of the cell\xe2\x80\x99s machinery to churn out new copies of the HIV virus, which eventually burst from the cell and infect neighboring cells. HIV-specific immune effector cells kill cells infected with HIV, but only when the cells are being used to produce more of the virus, meaning that the Tat gene circuit is switched on. In cells that are latently infected, the Tat gene circuit is off, and the cell goes about its normal business all the while harboring quiescent HIV.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy targeting the Tat gene circuit with drugs or small molecules to activate it, we would be able to cause latently-infected cells to start producing more virus, and then they can be destroyed by the immune system,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jie Liang, the Richard and Loan Hill Professor of Bioengineering in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering and a lead author of the paper. So far, there are no drugs successfully targeting this circuit.'
b'People infected with the HIV virus can live relatively normal lives with exceedingly low or even undetectable viral loads thanks to powerful antiretroviral therapies that work to suppress viral replication. But even in people where the virus is undetectable, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s completely absent. The HIV virus can hide in cells in an inactivated state, meaning it isn\xe2\x80\x99t actively replicating.'
b'This is a dire situation and makes life-long antiretroviral therapy the only option for HIV infected patients.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is extremely difficult to flush latently-infected cells out of their latency,\xe2\x80\x9d Liang said.'
b'Techniques developed to reactivate latent HIV-infected cells so that they become susceptible to the body\xe2\x80\x99s natural immune response or to drug therapies have had mixed results \xe2\x80\x94 mostly because the technique, known as \xe2\x80\x9cshock and kill,\xe2\x80\x9d relies on a class of drugs called HDAC inhibitors that come with severe adverse effects.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to better understand the mechanisms that regulate HIV latency so we can identify new opportunities for intervention and develop better drugs that can either lock viral particles in a latent state, or kill latent cells, or both,\xe2\x80\x9d Liang said.'
b'The Tat gene circuit has a random probability of being active or inactive, and the switch from inactive to active can happen spontaneously. \xe2\x80\x9cIn HIV-infected cells, reactivation of the Tat gene circuit is still a very rare event,\xe2\x80\x9d Liang said.'
b'Liang and his colleagues developed advanced computational algorithms to study the Tat gene circuit under different conditions.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cUsing different models and algorithms, we were able to accurately map a \xe2\x80\x98probability landscape\xe2\x80\x99 of the cellular reactions that can impact Tat gene circuit reactivation, and our results suggest new ways of targeting latent cells that may lead to the eradication of the HIV virus from a host,\xe2\x80\x9d Liang said.'
b'Liang and his colleagues identified ways to manipulate the Tat gene circuit so that the \xe2\x80\x9cshock and kill\xe2\x80\x9d technique would be more effective. They also looked at a \xe2\x80\x9cblock and lock\xe2\x80\x9d strategy, where latent viral particles are locked into latency by permanently blocking activation of the Tat gene circuit.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur results suggest that by controlling HIV latency through manipulation of the Tat gene circuit, effective therapeutic strategies can be identified that would one day provide a cure for HIV,\xe2\x80\x9d Liang said.'
b'Liang and Youfang Cao of Merck Research Laboratories are the lead authors of the study. Xue Lei from the University of Illinois at Chicago; and Alan S. Perelson and Ruy M. Ribeiro from the Los Alamos National Laboratory are the collaborators and co-authors on the paper.'
