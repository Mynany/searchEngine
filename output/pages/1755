b'Your First and Last Name\nYour UIN#\nFull Mailing Address\nCopy of the Front and Back of your Health Insurance Card\nExplanation for missing the deadline date'

b'By Fax:\xc2\xa0312.413.0254\nEmail: cchealth@uic.edu\nBy Mail:\xc2\xa0CampusCare Appeal Board\n818 S. Wolcott Ave, 7th\xc2\xa0Floor,\xc2\xa0MC972\nChicago, IL 60612'

b'Please allow 2 weeks for a decision. A letter will be mailed to the address provided on your application. Please note that appeals can be approved or denied based on the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s decision.'
b'CampusCare sends out 2 emails, to every email address\xc2\xa0the University has on file,\xc2\xa0for all registered students before the Enrollment Period Deadline Date every semester containing instructions on how to locate and submit the forms. CampusCare also speaks at all new/transfer student, parent, and college orientations regarding this information. Students who do not have extenuating/unusual circumstances will not receive an approved appeal. Being new to this school, not reading/opening your emails, or forgetting to fill out the form before the Enrollment Period Deadline Date are not extenuating or unusual circumstances and will not recieve approval of their appeal.'
b'Students who enroll after the deadline date do not have the option of waiving coverage per CampusCare\xe2\x80\x99s policy.'
