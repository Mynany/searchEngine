b'When softball player Erica Hampton graduates in December 2015, she will face a new challenge: powering a U.S. Navy ship.'
b'Hampton, a junior in electrical engineering, was recently accepted into the U.S. Navy\xe2\x80\x99s Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate Program. She will begin her training with Officer Candidate School in January 2016, then spend four years with the U.S. Navy and four years with the Navy Reserve.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an incredible honor to be accepted into the program,\xe2\x80\x9d Hampton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am looking forward to applying what I have learned from being an athlete here at UIC, as well as an electrical engineering student, to my job with the U.S. Navy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hampton will receive advanced nuclear power training to become qualified as a surface warfare officer.'
b'She will be deployed with the U.S. Navy and oversee the operation of the onboard nuclear reactor and propulsion plant.'
b'Hamilton interviewed with naval officers in San Diego and Washington, D.C., to be admitted into the program. She decided to apply after Kathleen Corcos, assistant director of the Engineering Career Center, told her it might be a good option.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to do something that keeps me busy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be powering the ships and I think the program is a good fit for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hampton already has a lot to keep her occupied \xe2\x80\x94 balancing her rigorous engineering course load as well as her busy softball schedule.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI get up at 5:30 and do weights, then have class and straight from there I go to practice, then back home to eat and study,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Hampton is an outstanding student and athlete, said head softball coach Michelle Venturella.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all so proud of Erica for this amazing accomplishment,\xe2\x80\x9d Venturella said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI love that she had the courage to pursue this lofty goal and reached it. She is one of the few women in the program and is paving the way for others to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hampton won\xe2\x80\x99t begin the U.S. Navy program for more than a year, so she\xe2\x80\x99s determined to reach another goal in mind in the meantime.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want to finish my senior year winning the conference and going to regionals,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
