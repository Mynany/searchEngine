b'We continually monitor weather and road conditions throughout the area. During snow and ice storms we work diligently to keep the Chicago campus open and accessible.\xc2\xa0 This involves work around the clock to clear the building entrances, streets, sidewalks and parking lots. Priority for snow and ice removal is always given to the hospital and ambulatory care areas, ADA entrances and parking spaces for persons with disabilities, emergency routes, and public walkways.'
b'Temporary closures of some parking lots and the top decks of parking structures may be required to allow snow and ice to be safely removed.\xc2\xa0 We may ticket or tow vehicles that disregard these closures.\xc2\xa0 Depending on weather conditions \xe2\x80\x94 a heavy snow, blowing wind, ice, and the timing of the storm \xe2\x80\x94 it may take a few days to completely clear the campus and trash removal and recycling pickups may be delayed.'
b'Use the 24/7 phone number, 5-SNOW (312-355-7669) to report any snow- or ice-related problems on campus. Please provide the following information: location, time, and a phone number or e-mail address for follow-up, if desired.'
b'Your patience and consideration are appreciated while our crews do their best to clear snow and ice.'
