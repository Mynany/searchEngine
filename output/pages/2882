b'M3 and M4 Years'
b'Unmatched Clinical Experience'
b'The College of Medicine at Rockford offers the most extensive longitudinal ambulatory experience of any medical school in the country. Starting in the M2 year, our students are assigned to one of our primary care clinics for intensive, hands-on clerkships, where they work closely with patients in a clinical setting.'

b'Psychiatry Clerkship'
b'General Description for the M3 Year'
b'Six-week clerkships in obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, family medicine and psychiatry, plus 12-week clerkships in medicine and surgery comprise the third-year experience, with students spending one day per week at their designated clinics. M3 instructional methods are a blend of didactic presentations, teaching rounds, case-based problem solving, computer-aided instruction, computer case simulations, student presentations, patient case discussions and seminars. Instruction and evaluation are based on faculty-approved learning objectives, and include passing the NBME Subject Exam in each discipline.'
b'M3 Course Breakdown'
b'M3 Year (48 weeks)'
b'General Description of the M4 Year'
b'The M4 year includes 16 weeks of selectives (four, four-week rotations), plus 16 weeks of electives. Eight weeks of discretionary time are available which students may use for preparation for USMLE Step 2 CS and CK, residency interviews or vacation. Students must pass Step 2 CS and CK of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) in order to graduate. A mock Step 2 CS standardized patient experience is offered at the beginning of the M4 year to prepare students for the clinical skills part of the Step 2 examination.'
b'Individual electives in the M4 year are either two or four weeks in duration. Rockford students may also choose elective experiences at other U.S. medical schools and/or to study abroad. The College of Medicine at Rockford is one of the few U.S. medical schools belonging to the International Network of Community-Oriented Educational Institutions for Health Sciences. Students are encouraged to see and experience medicine in varying contexts, including Third World settings via fellowships in cooperation with Network institutions and others.'
