b'Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct'
b'UIC is committed to providing an educational and work environment that is free from all forms of sex discrimination, sexual violence, and sexual and gender-based harassment (collectively referred to as \xe2\x80\x9csexual misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d).\nUIC prohibits and will not tolerate sexual misconduct of or by students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC will take prompt and fair action to eliminate such conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects through interim protective measures and accommodations, equitable investigations, and disciplinary processes. Employees and students in violation of this policy may face sanctions up to and including termination or expulsion. The Office for Access and Equity, through its Title IX Coordinator, has the authority to conduct investigations, to determine when there have been violations of this policy based on the standard of preponderance of evidence, and then make recommendations in accordance with the relevant University policies for students, employees, patients, or visitors.'
b'UIC encourages good faith reports of sexual misconduct and prohibits retaliation against any person who reports sexual misconduct and/or who participates in a Title IX investigation or resultant disciplinary process.'
b'All employees are considered to be \xe2\x80\x9cResponsible Employees\xe2\x80\x9d with the authority and responsibility to report Sexual Misconduct to University Officials.\xc2\xa0 Employees who are exempted from this reporting requirement are professional or pastoral counselors who provide work-related mental-health counseling, campus advocates who provide confidential victim assistance, and employees who are otherwise prohibited by law from disclosing information received in the course of providing professional care and treatment.'
