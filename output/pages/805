b"Heritage Garden, a CCUSC collaborative program, plugged on the Mayor's Sustainability News"
b"UIC's Heritage Garden has caught the attention of the Mayor's office. Their final volunteer day of the summer, August 7, 2018, was featured as one of Sustainable Chicago's upcoming events, alongside the Adler Planetarium and Green City Market."
b'Heritage Garden is a collaborative project among the seven Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change (CCUSC) with the program infrastructure provided by the Latino Cultural Center and paid internships provided and funded by the UIC Sustainability Fee.'
b"Student interns work with faculty, staff, and community members to connect horticulture with environmental sustainability, cultural diversity, and social justice. Eight satellite gardens, located on the east side of UIC's campus, are a part of this hands-on learning project, providing the impetus to research information on the plants they have grown in regard to plant cultivation and significance to cultural communities, including culinary and medicinal usage."
