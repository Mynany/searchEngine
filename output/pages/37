b'Researchers test app that monitors changes in typing patterns to predict\xe2\x80\x94and maybe someday treat\xe2\x80\x94psychological episodes.'
b'Laine Higgins\xc2\xa0 Wall Street Journal'
b'Laine Higgins'
b'A team of researchers at the Center on Depression and Resilience at the University of Illinois at Chicago is working on technology that could monitor users\xe2\x80\x99 mood and cognition\xe2\x80\x94important indicators of mental-health stress\xe2\x80\x94by tracking their typing patterns with an iPhone app called BiAffect. Initial research has found it is possible to predict episodes of mania and depression among users with bipolar and major depressive disorder based on changes in their typing habits.'
b'For instance, a manic episode may be preceded by rising numbers of typos, faster typing, more frequent use of the \xe2\x80\x9cdelete\xe2\x80\x9d key or tremors detected by the phone\xe2\x80\x99s accelerometer, which measures the device\xe2\x80\x99s tilting and orientation. During depressive episodes, users withdraw from their personal technology and tend to send short, infrequent messages.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t track what you type, but how you type it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Alex Leow, an associate professor from the university\xe2\x80\x99s College of Medicine and lead researcher on the project.'
b'\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0Rather than waiting until the patient shows up in somebody\xe2\x80\x99s office for intervention, you could do the intervention in real time through the same device that\xe2\x80\x99s monitoring their symptoms.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99'
b'\xe2\x80\x94Dr. Olusola Ajilore, an associate professor of psychiatry on the BiAffect team'
b'The BiAffect study is part of a larger trend in psychology of attempting to measure how the brain functions using \xe2\x80\x9cdigital exhaust\xe2\x80\x9d from users\xe2\x80\x99 daily interactions with technology. There are over 10,000 mental-health-related apps on the App Store, according to the National Institute of Mental Health\xe2\x80\x99s most recent count.'
b'The trouble is that evidence-backed apps like BiAffect that can substantiate their claims of effectiveness make up just 3% of that total, says Dr. Adam Haim, an NIMH expert on mental-health apps. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of promise,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of false promise out there as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The NIMH considers the development of digitally delivered interventions a priority because they have the potential to make treatment available to more people, decrease medication switch rates,\xc2\xa0reduce hospitalizations and perhaps lower medical costs in the long run.'
b'However, apps like BiAffect that passively collect data come with a host of ethical concerns, mostly related to privacy. False positives can have costly consequences for users if an app fails to properly de-identify data or is not compliant with federal health-data protection standards, says Dr. Haim. People \xe2\x80\x9cneed to understand the potential implications of opening themselves to the release of data to a third party,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.'
b'BiAffect\xe2\x80\x99s aim is to be \xe2\x80\x9cas unobtrusive as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Leow. After downloading the app, users opt into the study and allow the specially coded BiAffect keyboard to replace their iPhone\xe2\x80\x99s default version. The app then operates behind the scenes whenever a person uses their phone, compiling a trove of objective data.'
b'The goal with this approach, the researchers say, is to make an unbiased real-time assessment of users\xe2\x80\x99 mental state in their natural environments. Typical mental-health assessments are made by polling patients on their state of mind through questionnaires or in-person meetings in clinical settings, and they are prone to self-reporting bias and other collection flaws.'
b'Researchers made BiAffect available to the general public on the App Store in March and it has since yielded over 8,150 hours of data from more than 1,300 users. The app was created as part of the Mood Challenge, a contest funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that challenged researchers to find new ways to use Apple Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s open-source app development platform, ResearchKit, to study mood disorders.'
b'BiAffect\xe2\x80\x99s creators intentionally didn\xe2\x80\x99t limit the app for use in clinical settings, though they believe it could be most effective when used by mental-health professionals to monitor their patients. Such use is probably several years off, said Dr. Olusola Ajilore, an associate professor of psychiatry on the BiAffect team.'
b'But researchers hope the app will eventually allow clinicians to offer just-in-time interventions. \xe2\x80\x9cRather than waiting until the patient shows up in somebody\xe2\x80\x99s office for intervention, you could do the intervention in real time through the same device that\xe2\x80\x99s monitoring their symptoms,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.'
