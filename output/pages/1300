b'The Department of Civil and Materials Engineering (CME) offers programs leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in Civil Engineering, and the Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in Materials Engineering.'
b'Civil engineering is a broadly based discipline that encompasses many specialties in the areas of Structural engineering, Mechanics, Construction Materials, Environmental engineering, Water Resources engineering, Geotechnical & Geo-environmental engineering and Transportation engineering. By careful selection of elective courses, a student may choose to specialize in one or two technical areas. The civil engineering curriculum provides students with a strong background in engineering and applied sciences for professional careers in industry or government and for further graduate studies in civil engineering.'
b'The Materials Engineering Graduate Program is an interdisciplinary program designed for students who will be comfortable moving among disciplines, and facilitating interactions among scientists and engineers with different backgrounds. The program is research based, emphasizing hands-on involvement of students. The program is centered in the College of Engineering. A small core of fundamental courses on the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of materials is offered in the Civil and Materials Engineering Department, but the strength of the program is the variety of specialized materials related courses offered throughout the University.'
b'The Institute for Environmental Science and Policy (IESP) is a cross-campus center organized under the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at UIC. Its mission is to advance multidisciplinary research and scholarship within the environmental health sciences and engineering, economics, social thought, and policy among UIC\xe2\x80\x99s faculty and students, transmit workable solutions for environmental problems to the public sectors, and to prepare the next generation of environmental decision-makers. IESP\xe2\x80\x99s core theme is to advance the understanding of how urbanization affects environmental and human well-being.'
