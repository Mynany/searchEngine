b'Alex Iacobucci'
b'By David Staudacher'
b'Located in the heart of Chicago, UIC offers students a unique educational experience and work opportunities in a world-class city. For Alex Iacobucci, UIC\xe2\x80\x99s electrical and computer engineering department set the stage for his professional career as an engineer and provided him with the opportunity to do some acting outside the office.'
b'Iacobucci came to campus through the UIC College of Engineering\xe2\x80\x99s partnership with one of the top engineering schools in Italy \xe2\x80\x93 Polytechnic University of Turin. The partnership provides the international students with a dual master\xe2\x80\x99s degree from the Italian university and UIC. They take one semester in Italy and one semester at UIC, where they can extend the time needed to finish the courses and thesis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an interesting program as we got to see different teaching methods in Italy and the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was really challenging. One was more theory based, and one [UIC] was more practice based with a lot of assignments throughout the semester.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At UIC, he worked under the direction of electrical and computer engineering department head Rashid Ansari in the Multimedia Communications Laboratory. It was the positive experience that help him grow as an engineer.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was always super nice. He was always available, yet he gave us a ton of autonomy, which I liked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iacobucci. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very proactive in getting us our equipment, he made it possible to get a powerful computer that we needed for our operations, and he was always available to meet or respond to emails.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In the lab, Iacobucci worked on a project that was a partnership with Altera/Intel. The team had to prove that by using a specific algorithm that they had to come up with, using their latest FPGA that it was possible to achieve better results in MRI image transformation than with current technology.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe got a chance to work with an expert from Intel and their top notch latest product,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very challenging and really rewarding.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He praised the program for providing him with a different perspective of engineering research.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to go to the U.S. or you want to face another reality and expand your horizons,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if you want to go back to Italy. It\xe2\x80\x99s always nice to open up and see what happens here. It is well known that American universities provide a significant contribution to scientific research, so it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to observe their approach. Regardless of what your final life objective is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a positive experience that I would recommend.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Iacobucci also praised Lynn Thomas, program coordinator for the master of engineering and international programs.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe is fantastic and has been helpful throughout the whole process,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was available whenever we had questions or doubts on our deliverables for the program. She was a great resource. She would respond to emails in little time or she would be in her office if you wanted to talk to her in person.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Iacobucci loves living in Chicago and everything the city has to offer.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always something going on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe theater scene is amazing and the prices are affordable, rent wise and restaurant wise.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Iacobucci graduated in 2016 with a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree from the electrical and computer engineering department. Now, he is working as a software engineer at Chicago-based HERE Technologies. HERE creates living 3D maps that grow upward, breathing with layers of information and insights.'
b'Since he is still young in his career, he has ambitions of moving up the corporate ladder.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would say my dream job is probably being an architect,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou create a structure for the system. You are building the architecture that is behind the system.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When he\xe2\x80\x99s not working as an engineer at HERE, he can be seen on stage performing in musicals.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cRight now, I\xe2\x80\x99m in \xe2\x80\x98Chicago\xe2\x80\x99 the musical in Des Plaines,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iacobucci. \xe2\x80\x9cMy next stop is going to be at Pride Films and Plays, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a play with dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Iacobucci is only one of the many UIC students who graduated from this international program and landed at a top company.'
