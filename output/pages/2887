b''
b'I participated in a semester, year, or summer abroad program. Do I need to submit a transcript from the Institution where I studied abroad?'
b'If your study abroad work was completed during your last 60 semester hours or last 90 quarter hours of your undergraduate coursework, and it is not listed on your current University\xe2\x80\x99s transcript as study abroad credit, you will need to upload an official transcript from the study abroad institution.'
b''
b'I am applying for readmission to the Graduate College. I submitted credentials when I was first admitted. Do I need to submit them again?'
b'The Office of Admissions typically keeps the records of students who were admitted and registered for classes for ten years. If you are applying for readmission, there is a chance that the documents you initially submitted are still on file. An admissions counselor will be able to verify if your old records are still here and if they can be used toward completing your new application. In some cases, you will be asked to upload credentials. If you were previously admitted as a graduate student but never registered, you will need to submit credentials through the application system as required for your program.'
b''
b'Application Process'
b'Uploading Documents'
b'When can I upload my academic credentials?'
b'Application records are ready to accept electronic documents within 3-5 business days after submission of the application, but it may be sooner. An Acknowledgement email is sent out. Admissions staff will then audit your application record to determine the appropriate credentials request. A brief update email will be sent out.'
b''
b'What file types and sizes are acceptable to upload?'
b''
b'How will I know if you accepted the documents I have uploaded?'
b'Each item can be verified as received and accepted by checking the Received Date and the Item Status field, which will indicate whether the requirement has been satisfied by the submitted document. Item Statuses with a green checkmark indicate that the document is accepted. Item Statuses with a red x indicate that there was an issue with your document. If a date does not appear in the Received Date field after an upload attempt, it means that the document has not been successfully uploaded. Additional requests may be added after submitted items are reviewed by Admissions or program staff, so be sure to check your status on a regular basis.'
b''
b'How do I upload my documents electronically?'
b'The link in the notification email will direct you to your application login webpage where you can begin uploading required items individually as required.

You may check your status using the LoginID and password you created when you began the application. Any documents that we are currently requesting will be posted under the Requirements section without a Received Date. Updates made to your account will be reflected immediately in both the Received Date and Status fields.'
b'Applications referred to the department will be noted as such. You will also be able to see if your application has been referred to the Graduate College for additional review. The Office of Admissions cannot provide a timeline for when these reviews will be completed.

b''
b'What does \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d transcripts/degree mean?'
b'Official documents are those which have been issued by your university and bear an original attestation. In the United States, sealed transcripts issued directly from the Registrar\xe2\x80\x99s office are considered official. The university may issue transcripts directly to UIC or to the student. As long as the seal is not broken, the transcripts will be considered official. We will not accept transcripts or degrees printed off the web.'
b'From foreign institutions, copies of original documents which have been attested by the Registrar or Controller of Examinations and sealed by the same individual will be considered as official. Each document should be attested.'
b''
b'My documents have been reviewed by the United States Educational Foundation (Education USA). Are these acceptable? Are they considered official?'
b'UIC does not consider academic credentials which have passed through the hands of a third party as official. We may take these documents for processing purposes if they fulfill our requirements. However, in order for documents to be considered official, they always need to be submitted from the issuing university directly.'
b''
b'I sent official documents from an international institution. Why am I being asked for them again?'
b'Documents may be considered unofficial for the following reasons:'
b''
b'My documents are in a language other than English. What is an acceptable method for having them translated?'
b'The Office of Admissions requires literal, certified translations for all documents issued in a language other than English. Translations should be on a translator\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead and should be literal (not an interpretation). We accept translations from ATA certified translators, court-appointed translators, or from the consulate. You may find an ATA translator at their web site: www.atanet.org. Plain translations, notarized translations, and translations done by someone other than a certified translator are not acceptable. Evaluations performed by agencies such as WES and ECE will not be used in place of certified translations.'
b'www.atanet.org'
b''
b'Should I obtain an ECE or WES evaluation?'
b'For students applying to graduate programs, the Office of Admissions does not require students to submit credential evaluations (ECE or WES reports). The Graduate Admissions office will perform its own review of your academic course work. We will not accept evaluations performed by another agency in place of your original transcripts, mark sheets, or degrees. Evaluations will also not be used in place of certified, English translations.'
b''
b'Supporting Documents required by the Program'
b'What supporting documents do I need to submit along with my application?'
b'Please note that as part of the application, besides transcripts, GRE, and TOEFL scores you will also need to upload your personal statement and a CV through the online application.

b''

b''
b'I received a letter from the MBT Program recommending me for admission. Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t I been admitted?'
b'The MBT Program does not have the authority to officially admit you to the University. The letter you have received from the MBT Program states our intention to recommend you for admission to the program. This recommendation must then be reviewed by the Office of Admissions and approved by the Graduate College. Typically, applicants can expect an admission letter from the Graduate College or a follow-up letter from the Program (in case the recommendation is not approved) in a few weeks following the initial program letter.'
b''
b'Why was my application cancelled?'
b'Cancellations may be made by the Office of Admissions or by the MBT Program. Your application may have been cancelled for the following reasons:'
b''
b'How can I defer my admission?'
b'Students who have been recommended for admission, but cannot attend for valid reasons, may request to defer their admission. An admitted application can only be deferred once for up to 1 academic year (applicants admitted for the Fall term may defer to the following Spring, Summer, or Fall terms). Admission to the term is contingent upon departmental admissions practices for that term. Students do not need to submit a new application, fee, or set of academic credentials in order for a deferral to be granted.'
b''
b'Who qualifies for a deferral?'
b'Only students who have been recommended admission by the department or officially admitted by the Graduate College are eligible to defer admission. Denied applications and those cancelled due to missing academic credentials cannot be deferred.'
b''
b'How do I seek a deferral?'
b'You will need to contact the MBT program to request a deferral. The program has the authority to grant your request or to deny it. Program awards may not be guaranteed for a new term. The MBT program then forwards requests to the Admissions Office for final approval. An admitted application record is created for approved deferred admission terms and a new admission letter is mailed out.'
b'International Students \xe2\x80\x94 If your deferral is approved, you may need to submit new evidence of financial support for the new term. You would need to contact the Office of International Services for further details about your specific case. \xc2\xa0OIS is informed of all international admits, so you would also be included in correspondence indicating whether or not financial documents are needed for the approved deferred admission term.'
b''
