b'Quote'
b'If you expose students to difference as part of a normal thing, as opposed to \xe2\x80\x98we will now have a program about difference\xe2\x80\x99 No! We study with people who are not all just like us, in spaces that are not just all the ones we\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with, so if we do normal, everyday things in other spaces we\xe2\x80\x99ll be less intimidated to cross borders. Totally makes sense.'
b'A Very Brief History of the AACC'
b''
b'UIC\xe2\x80\x99s African American Cultural Center (AACC) was a couple of decades in the making. Efforts to establish such a space began alongside conversations that culminated in the creation of the Black Studies Program (now the Department of African American Studies) at UIC, then known as the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, in the early 1970s. \xc2\xa0Both of these endeavors were part of the pioneering work of Professor Grace Sims Holt, who became the first Director for the Black Studies Program in 1974 and remained so until 1986. According to Dr. Lori Baptista, former AACC Director, Professor Holt \xe2\x80\x9cwas instrumental in envisioning what [the AACC] would be.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Twenty years would pass before the AACC was actually funded and established in 1991. Bolstered by racially and gender-based incidents in the early 1990s, a coalition of campus and community partners, allies, political leadership, and students demanded funding for the center. Following a series of interim directors, Dr. Phillip Royster, Professor of African American Studies and English at UIC, was appointed as permanent Director. In 1994, the AACC was moved to its current location in Addams Hall. Dr. Royster served as Director for over twenty years, creating and sustaining the Visiting Artists Series, a monthly installation highlighting the work of local African American artists, throughout his time at the AACC.'
b'Visiting Artists Series'
b'Dr. Lori Baptista Joins UIC'
b'Following Dr. Royster\xe2\x80\x99s retirement, the AACC welcomed Dr. Lori Baptista as its new Director in 2011. Dr. Baptista, who holds a PhD in Performance Studies from Northwestern University, brought with her extensive experience researching and developing arts-based and critically engaging cultural programming, as well as working with communities and organizations throughout the Chicagoland area. Prior to joining UIC, and along with Dr. Rosa Cabrera, current Director of the Rafael Cintr\xc3\xb3n Ortiz Latino Cultural Center at UIC, Dr. Baptista was part of an urban ethnography team at The Field Museum, and worked on a series of grant-funded projects focused on cultural diversity and environmental sustainability in various Chicago neighborhoods. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was really unique and wonderful about our work there is that we took a very assets-based approach in thinking about communities and identity,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Baptista recounts, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want people to make positive changes in their lives, that benefit both themselves and the environment, how do you not just come in and prescribe to them what they need to do? How do you really respect the fact that cultural communities, themselves very diverse, have values and beliefs and practices and things that are important to them? How do you harness that first, and make a connection for them between the things they already feel are important and these other kinds of environmental priorities?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Rafael Cintr\xc3\xb3n Ortiz Latino Cultural Center'
b'Charged with breathing new life into the AACC and working to further integrate it into other vital university functions, Dr. Baptista\xe2\x80\x99s vision for the AACC, and all the work that followed, was guided by this assets-based approach to community building and sustainability.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was interested in the position [of AACC Director] in that way because cultural centers at universities are often located in different places [and university units] and the cultural centers [at UIC] were located in Academic Affairs, which was appealing to me because in there is an opportunity to influence curricula, to partner very directly with faculty and academic units, as well as partnering with student affairs units, [and] also to bring in research-based, data-driven frameworks to help support cultural approaches. I was excited about what I could do to bring an assets-based approach to the cultural center to try to reinvigorate it. And that was really the charge at the time that I was hired. To help the center become more relevant, to become more deeply connected in very structured, but also very practical ways to academic units, and then to build relationships where it made sense both in the campus community and outside of campus.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The AACC\xe2\x80\x99s space itself had not been renovated since 1994, so first things first, Dr. Baptista\xe2\x80\x99s tenure began with the practical aspects: asbestos\xc2\xa0abatement, recarpeting, and bringing the space into the 21st century.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOver the years,\xe2\x80\x9d she explains, \xe2\x80\x9cwe put in some AV as funds became available, we put in a TV, we got a lot of stuff from surplus, we repurposed a lot of things, but the whole idea [was] how do you engage more people to use the space? [The] visiting artists series was kind of, it was up and there were announcements made about it, and maybe people passed through, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t tied to the curriculum, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t tied to community tours or anything, so part of the idea for the renovation was to think about how all these spaces would be used, and who would be using them, and how I would bring in partners to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An initial project was documenting the AACC\xe2\x80\x99s history, particularly the struggles and events that led to its founding, which had not been properly recorded when Dr. Baptista joined as Director. Dr. Royster was particularly helpful in this regard, but \xe2\x80\x9cit required quite a bit of archival work,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Baptista recalls.'
b'While excavating the AACC\xe2\x80\x99s history, Dr. Baptista began to focus on the center\xe2\x80\x99s future as well, working to build relationships with partners both within and outside UIC. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, if we shared this common genealogy with African American Studies, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to me that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a formal structured relationship with the unit,\xe2\x80\x9d she explains. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I spent like the first year doing the campus tour. I met with the heads of various academic and other units to understand what they already did, what they knew about the center, how they worked with the center in the past, and to see what opportunities there might be to work together in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Reinvigorating AACC Programs and Initiatives: Expanding Engagement and Reach'
b'From the beginning, under the leadership of Dr. Royster, the AACC was meant to be \xe2\x80\x9ca very arts-based, practice-based arm, [a hub that would] support students in a number of different ways that were tied more closely to the curriculum as opposed to just social activities,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Baptista. The numerous programs and initiatives developed during Dr. Baptista\xe2\x80\x99s tenure continued in this vein and stressed the significance of assets-based frameworks and research-based programming.'
b'Aside from the Visiting Artists Series, which was meant to provide a platform for young, aspiring Black artists, and to highlight Black culture and tie it into campus conversations, the AACC was mostly being used as a meeting space. Programming budgets had not been increased, \xe2\x80\x9cand there was no room to really develop new programming,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Baptista explains. While funding has remained hard to come by, Dr. Baptista figured out ways to develop partnerships and bring in internal and external grants to fund a number of AACC and collaborative initiatives. For instance, in recent years the AACC has received support from the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement (IPCE) at CUPPA, the Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s Committee on the Status of Women, and the Illinois Humanities Council.'
b'Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement'
b'Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s Committee on the Status of Women'

b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a mindset about how you support students as a cultural center,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Dr. Baptista, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes that\xe2\x80\x99s about \xe2\x80\x9cyou let them have social events in your space,\xe2\x80\x9d and that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way to do things. That\xe2\x80\x99s actually not been our mission. Our mission is really engaged around supporting the academic and diversity missions through very thoughtfully conceived and measured initiatives that relate the Black experience to a number of different points, right? [If] you\xe2\x80\x99re a cultural center people think it\xe2\x80\x99s just a social event, that you just do programs. There\xe2\x80\x99s this presumption that there\xe2\x80\x99s no thought behind programming. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just do stuff, well, how come you can\xe2\x80\x99t just do more?\xe2\x80\x9d You dream up a program in the shower and you come in, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a program! I had to argue with someone about the need for research support and they were like, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not a research center, why do you need research support?\xe2\x80\x9d Well, we do historical exhibits, you actually have to research them. Even if you were just doing genre-based exhibits, if you were looking at \xe2\x80\x9cBlack post-structuralist\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, impressionist painters, you would still need to research it. So there\xe2\x80\x99s a presumption that programming is like this thing you just do, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no framework or no explicit goal.'
b'In 2012, the AACC launched its Summer Arts Festival, which aimed to increase visibility and strengthen campus and community partnerships. Through a series of arts and research-focused workshops, the festival\xe2\x80\x99s program fostered engagement with various African Diaspora and African traditions and public celebrations.'
b'Summer Arts Festival'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I should say, before we started doing things, part of my listening tour, because I come from an assets-based approach, we did asset mapping. We needed to understand who were the stakeholders in the center, what were the concerns that people had, what were the visions or the ideas that people had for the center in terms of what they thought it was or what it should be, who it should serve or how it should serve [them].\xc2\xa0 So the biggest initiative we started off with, which was a kind of \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome to this new space that we renovated, and here\xe2\x80\x99s new leadership, and here\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to approach these things\xe2\x80\x9d was the Summer Arts Festival\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When UIC\xe2\x80\x99s School of Art and Art History launched the Museum and Exhibition Studies M.A. Program, Dr. Baptista was invited as affiliate faculty, and this new partnership allowed for participation by Museum and Exhibition Studies graduate students in the curatorial process for programs at AACC.'
b'Museum and Exhibition Studies M.A. Program'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a nice way again, within the institution, to build a relationship with an academic unit where the assets that we had, which were gallery space and the ability to create exhibitions, were a value to them. So students would have practical experience doing that. Part of the practicum in class involves in some way generating an exhibition for the cultural center [such as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cavalcade of the American Negro,\xe2\x80\x9d curated by Jacqueline Smith in 2015]. And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a number of the exhibits that have come out of that work, either through [Graduate Assistantships] or student [coursework] to build content material. That has been a very successful partnership that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had for many years now. Two of the Fall exhibits that are coming up now are coming out of the seminar that I just taught this spring for Exhibition Practices.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Cavalcade of the American Negro'
b'The AACC\xe2\x80\x99s focus on arts-based, critically engaging programming has produced a number of well-received exhibitions. One example is \xe2\x80\x9cThe Reason Why\xe2\x80\x9d (June 6th \xe2\x80\x93 October 11th, 2013), a historical exhibit meant to illuminate African American participation at the World\xe2\x80\x99s Columbian Exposition, or lack thereof. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that was one of the programs that I\xe2\x80\x99m most proud of,\xe2\x80\x9d shares Dr. Baptista, \xe2\x80\x9cin terms of the impact it had, its relevance.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a lot of units, History, Sociology, African American Studies, all over campus, that tied it in as a co-curricular activity, which was also part of the goal and so that was fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d An earlier exhibition presented in 2012, \xe2\x80\x9cBlack/Inside\xe2\x80\x9d, was a collaboration with Project NIA, an organization emphasizing participatory community justice, as well as the College of Architecture and the Arts at UIC. A timely exhibition, it explored the relationship between the conditions of slavery and mass incarceration.'

b'I think [these exhibitions were] successful not only because so many people came, but [also] because they were very relevant and timely. [They also] did what we do well, which is use research-driven approaches to look at historical events, or social events, issues, or concerns and engage people around those areas in ways that also involve aesthetics.'
b'In 2013, the AACC collaborated with a number of community-based veteran service organizations, the Office of the Dean of Students/Student Veteran Affairs, and the UIC ROTC, to develop \xe2\x80\x9cThe Things We Carried\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your service,\xe2\x80\x9d which explored the experiences of student veterans more broadly, and of African Americans and people of color in the military, more specifically, while highlighting the complex intersections of race, class, and gender in this context.'
b'The Things We Carried'
b'Thank you for your service'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe curated from our community partners\xe2\x80\x99 collections to put together a timeline of African Americans in the military, and hosted a series of dialogues around those issues, which were really productive and engaging with that particular community. What we were also hearing, as the Student Veterans unit was being established, is that as more students who were veterans were returning from the war in Iraq and were accessing their benefits and enrolling in classes, they were being asked really inappropriate questions in class by peers, or they were dealing with stereotypes [about African American and Latino participation in the Military].\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy intention for this space is not that it\xe2\x80\x99s a closed unit, where everything just happens here and I\xe2\x80\x99m in charge of it all. It has to make sense and be of value, and address issues that are already important to people, or be of use to other units,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Baptista. This emphasis on collaboration remains a cornerstone for the AACC, and for the six other Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change (CCUSCs) that are currently part of the Office of Diversity, whose Directors meet once a month to discuss potential collaborative projects and thematic foci (such as UIC\xe2\x80\x99s Heritage Garden and Internship).'
b'Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change'
b'UIC\xe2\x80\x99s Heritage Garden and Internship'
b'For the AACC, a particularly significant collaborative initiative has been to develop exhibitions and other co-curricular materials that could be tied to the Illinois Fine Arts and Social Science curricula for K-12.'
b'We had a lot of high school groups, and grammar school groups actually, that would come to our campus and they wanted to visit the AACC. So, rather than just have people come to hear us say \xe2\x80\x9cHi, we\xe2\x80\x99re the African American Cultural Center and these are the kinds of things we do,\xe2\x80\x9d why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just create a [program] that is tailored to when they come? So we started to adapt our tours, for example, to meet the curricular standards. If a teacher were to bring a group of 6th graders, we could take them through an activity that maps to the Illinois standards, so they are getting something out of this than just understanding that this is a space that Black students fought for.'
b'Beyond expanding the reach and relationships of the AACC, under Dr. Baptista\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, and in collaboration with campus and community partners, the AACC has also worked to broaden perspectives regarding Blackness, and to integrate the diverse, and yet interconnected, experiences of Black Diaspora cultures: African Americans from Chicago and elsewhere in the United States, African-African-Americans, Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Latinx cultures, to enumerate just a few.'
b'From \xe2\x80\x9cBlack/Inside,\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Reason Why,\xe2\x80\x9d and from some of the more specific thematic programs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that have been very intentionally about these intercultural dynamics, \xe2\x80\x9cCintio Vitier\xe2\x80\x9d was another one that was more recent, [our audiences can see that] actually Black people are also Hispanic, you know, Black people exist in other planes, and actually there are points of connection that people might not realize they have until they see it and recognize it.'
b'Cintio Vitier'
b'Valuing the work of the CCUSCs'
b'While in the process of transitioning into her new position as Associate Dean of Undergraduate Programs and Advising at Northwestern University\xe2\x80\x99s School of Communication, Dr. Baptista shared some of her hopes for the future of the AACC and the various centers at UIC.'
b'I think [Associate Chancellor and Vice Provost for Diversity] Dr. Amalia Pallares has a unique way of looking at cultural representation that\xe2\x80\x99s not just symbolic, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just \xe2\x80\x9cwe need X number of whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d so I\xe2\x80\x99m excited that the future will be more of this kind of meaningful engagements from an assets-based approach. What have you already done? What do you have the capacity to do? Who\xe2\x80\x99s in the network that could speak to this particular issue? [\xe2\x80\xa6] And what are the things that are already being done that could just be amplified as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cwe need fifteen new things\xe2\x80\x9d?'
b'It Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Where You\xe2\x80\x99re From'
b'The AACC\xe2\x80\x99s Summer 2018 exhibit, \xe2\x80\x9cIt Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Where You\xe2\x80\x99re From,\xe2\x80\x9d underscores some of the intercultural dynamics and complex interrelations among Diasporic groups that Dr. Baptista points out above. It is also based on her own work.'
b'It Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Where You\xe2\x80\x99re From'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy own research, outside of here, I looked at food and identity, and how people communicate aspects of who they are and how they see themselves in the world through food.\xc2\xa0 It also ends up being this complicated history of place and time, and never as clean and straight as people might imagine. There are always these very interesting points of overlap and intersection that people discover when you\xe2\x80\x99re reading someone\xe2\x80\x99s very particular story. Even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not your story you get to a point and you\xe2\x80\x99re like \xe2\x80\x9cWe totally make collard greens too!\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe your version is different from my version, but we have this thing in common now that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know we had\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Drawing from fieldwork and visual documentation of the relationship between food and identity in a Portuguese ethnic enclave in Newark, NJ (Dr. Baptista\xe2\x80\x99s hometown), the exhibition explores stories of global mobility, race and identity, and community struggle and survival. It aims to challenge notions of belonging, difference, place, and place-making. If you missed it, check out the exhibition\xe2\x80\x99s site for links to a virtual tour and Dr. Baptista\xe2\x80\x99s artist talk at the exhibition\xe2\x80\x99s opening: It Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Where You\xe2\x80\x99re From.'

b'In addition to numerous initiatives and exhibitions, the AACC also rents out its space to student organizations and hosts Open Study Hours during the academic year. Some professors have been known to use their library space for Office Hours, which, according to Dr. Baptista, can be a great way to reach those students who may not otherwise engage outside the classroom.'

b'Even if you\xe2\x80\x99re just using this space for quiet study, you will learn something about Black history, Black culture, cultural practices, and traditions, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of who we are, but [\xe2\x80\xa6] that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be your experience to appreciate it. It has to have value to more than just the people who self-identify in that way, so that\xe2\x80\x99s been a nice balance to provide people with different ways in.'
