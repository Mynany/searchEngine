b'Guaranteed Admission Program Agreement with University of Wisconsin (UW) at Platteville'
b'The Guaranteed Admission Program Affiliation Agreement between UIC, College of Medicine at Rockford (Master of Science in Medical Biotechnology Program) and the University of Wisconsin (UW) at Platteville offers provisionally guaranteed admission to the MS in Medical Biotechnology degree at UIC while the student is finishing an undergraduate degree at UW-Platteville. If accepted into the program, the student may take up to five hours of UIC Medical Biotechnology (MBT) courses in the senior year as a UIC nondegree undergraduate student. Ultimately this coursework will apply toward the UIC MS in Medical Biotechnology program, and is also transferred back to UW-Platteville to apply toward the undergraduate degree in biology as well.'
