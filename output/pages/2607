b'Since 1966, the Silver Circle Award has been presented to some of UIC\xe2\x80\x99s best teachers. Winners, who are honored at their college commencements, receive $500 and their names join a long list of distinguished colleagues. But what makes the award especially meaningful is its selection committee: the graduating seniors.'

b'Joseph Hummel\xe2\x80\x99s undergraduate course isn\xe2\x80\x99t the most popular class on campus.\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s Computer Science 109, required for engineering students who aren\xe2\x80\x99t planning to become computer scientists.\xc2\xa0So Hummel was surprised when students recognized him with a Silver Circle award.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that a lot of students went out of their way to say nice things, which is really remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hummel, research associate professor of computer science.'
b'Each semester, he teaches 230 students about C++ and programming with MATLAB. He makes the large lecture hall feel smaller by using clickers to get students involved.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI try to make the class interactive,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI use a model called peer instruction, where you ask questions during class. Students answer them and then discuss amongst themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s effective \xe2\x80\x94 more people come to class, the grades are better and I think the learning is better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hummel also teaches CS 341, an upper-level programming languages course for computer science majors.'
b'He was a researcher at UIC from 1998 to 2000, then left to teach at Lake Forest College. He returned in 2012.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the energy of the students,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI like their diverse backgrounds and that they are motivated. I enjoy what they bring to class.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hummel\xe2\x80\x99s interest in computer science started in high school. His current research focuses on parallel programming \xe2\x80\x94 how to make programs run faster on today\xe2\x80\x99s computer hardware.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou get to build stuff and it\xe2\x80\x99s fun,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.'
b'He lives in Evanston with his wife, Marybeth Lore, a physician, and their daughter Dai-Lin, 13, adopted from China. He tells his students about his family and his passion for sailing on Lake Michigan.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI like the students to know it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about work,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.'
