This is demonstrated through our ongoing prevention and awareness programs to eliminate criminal activity and to encourage students, faculty and staff to be responsible for both their own safety and the safety of others. These programs equip the University community to work collectively to prevent, protect, mitigate and respond to threats to our campus and the communities we serve.
