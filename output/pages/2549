b'Pointer disappointed after NU loss'

b'Tasha Pointer, head UIC women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach, returned to Welsh-Ryan Arena eager to earn a road victory over Northwestern.'
b'UIC coach Tasha Pointer knew facing Northwestern at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston would be tough.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cObviously, we wanted to win,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t give our best effort.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The difficult road game Nov. 15 against the Wildcats was scheduled way before the former NU assistant coach left last season to coach the Flames.'
b'Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s game was the first time Pointer had appeared at Welsh-Ryan as a head coach. And though UIC lost 87-44, she feels the matchup can have a positive impact.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNorthwestern came out and punched us first and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to respond,\xe2\x80\x9d Pointer told reporters after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cFor UIC, we have to allow this game to drive us to be better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'NU coach Joe McKeown praised Pointer\xe2\x80\x99s performance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just think great things are ahead for her at UIC,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey made a commitment to women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball when they hired her last spring. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see that over the next couple of years.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pointer is confident the Flames will bounce back.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all,\xc2\xa0 Coach McKeown is a phenomenal coach. One of the things that I learned from him was \xe2\x80\x94 no matter what \xe2\x80\x94 run your stuff and have great expectations of your team and have your team execute,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Pointer had hoped for a more triumphant homecoming after beating Valparaiso 75-65 on Nov. 7.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cComing into the (NU) game I was just conflicted,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to lose to their former team and, for that matter, any team?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Anytime you take over a program that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been as successful, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to appreciate these moments and in between because they are teaching moments,\xe2\x80\x9d Pointer said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMoving forward, for us at UIC, it is allowing moments like this to help elevate our mentality, our culture and really transform the program,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
