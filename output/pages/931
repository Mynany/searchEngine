b'Experience the Rockford Campus'
b'The College of Pharmacy is considered One College. Two Campuses. \xc2\xa0This means that regardless of the campus you choose, you are benefiting from the same accreditation, rankings, and reputation that a UIC degree provides. \xc2\xa0The Rockford campus also provides in-state tuition to out-of-state and international students through the College of Pharmacy Tuition Scholarship. \xc2\xa0'

b'College of Pharmacy Tuition Scholarship'
b'Lectures are live and taught via state-of-the-art broadcast learning from both campuses. Students on the Rockford campus have ample opportunities to pursue extracurricular and leadership roles, as well as participate in research, clinical and service-based hands-on learning. In addition to the College\xe2\x80\x99s close ties to the University of Illinois College of Medicine and College of Nursing at Rockford, the city of Rockford is home to a variety of community pharmacies and health-systems where students gain excellent experiences. Students interested in a career in rural pharmacy can choose to be admitted to the Rural Pharmacy Program (RPHARM) which is based in Rockford.'

b'A letter from the dean'
b'Welcome to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Pharmacy at Rockford!\xc2\xa0 The UIC College of Pharmacy\xe2\x80\x99s Rockford campus was established in 2010 to train pharmacists who provide quality patient care throughout Illinois and the United States.\xc2\xa0 Students enrolled at the Rockford campus study in modern state-of-the-art classrooms and laboratories specifically designed to meet the training needs for preparing 21st century pharmacists.\xc2\xa0 Newly constructed classrooms are outfitted with audiovisual equipment that allow classes to be delivered synchronously with the Chicago campus.\xc2\xa0 Live lectures are taught from both the Chicago and Rockford campuses allowing the College to utilize faculty who are experts in their fields to simultaneously teach students on both campuses.\xc2\xa0 Coordinated with the lectures, small group discussions are held on each campus and led by in-person faculty who facilitate student interaction, discussion, and understanding of the material.\xc2\xa0 Laboratory sessions for pharmacy skills and pharmaceutical compounding provide hands-on experience to help our students as they provide patient care through our experiential curriculum, starting in their first semester of pharmacy school.'
b'Our Rockford campus is part of the UIC Health Sciences Campus, home to the UIC College of Medicine and College of Nursing in Rockford.\xc2\xa0 Located on the banks of the Rock River, Rockford is the fourth largest city in Illinois and offers a small city feel for students who may prefer this.\xc2\xa0 The campus sits on 20 acres in a residential area of Rockford near the Rock River and nationally-recognized Anderson Japanese Gardens. \xc2\xa0The smaller class size in Rockford and interactions with College of Medicine and College of Nursing students provides unique interprofessional education opportunities for our students. Pharmacy student organizations, professional fraternities, and clubs are all available to choose from as you develop into an excellent and caring pharmacist.'
b'Anderson Japanese Gardens'
b'For students interested in practicing in a rural community upon graduation the Rockford Campus offers the Rural Pharmacy Education Program (RPHARM).\xc2\xa0 The goal of the RPHARM concentration is to educate students about the unique challenges and opportunities present in rural communities.\xc2\xa0 Approximately 20% of our current student population takes part in this concentration.\xc2\xa0 Upon graduation, students in the RPHARM Program are recognized as having completed a concentration in rural pharmacy services.\xc2\xa0 Over their four years in pharmacy school RPHARM students work interprofessionally with medical and nursing students enrolled in the Rural Medical Education Program (RMED) and Rural Nursing Program (RNURSING).'
b'The UIC College of Pharmacy at Chicago and Rockford offer students a top tier nationally ranked pharmacy education.\xc2\xa0 While a student on the Rockford campus, students will benefit from faculty who have an open-door policy and pride themselves on great student mentorship and guidance.\xc2\xa0 Rockford\xe2\x80\x99s small class size, close-knit student and faculty community, opportunities for interprofessional activities, and a lower cost of living are perfect for students considering a premier UIC College of Pharmacy education with these added bonuses.'
