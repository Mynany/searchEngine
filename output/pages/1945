b'\n\n\n\nComputational Intelligence\nClick here\nComputational intelligence combines elements of learning, adaptation, evolution and\nfuzzy logic (rough sets) to create systemss that are, in some sense, intelligent.\nOur research covers neural\nnetworks, fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation, including swarm intelligence,\nas well as their applications.\nComputational Neuroscience\nClick here\n\n\nIntelligent Control and Learning Control\nClick here\nClick here\nClick here \nClick here\nBook |\nBook |\nBook |\nBook\n\n Our current interest in this field is\n    neural network-based approaches for intelligent systems and learning control.\n    In particular, our study is focused on neural network-based\n    adaptive critic designs. Adaptive critic designs are designs\n    that approximate dynamic\n       programming in the general case, i.e., approximate optimal control\n    over time in noisy, nonlinear environments. There are many practical\n       problems that can be formulated as to minimize or maximize\n    a measure of cost.\n    It is well-known that dynamic programming is very useful in\n    solving these problems.\n       However, it is often computationally untenable to run true dynamic\n    programming due to the backward numerical process required for its\n       solutions, i.e., due to the "curse of dimensionality."\n    Over the years, progress has been made to circumvent the\n    "curse of dimensionality" by\n       building a system, called "critic" to approximate the cost\n    function in dynamic programming. The idea is to approximate dynamic\n       programming solutions by using a function approximation structure\n    such as neural networks to approximate the cost function.\n    Our work includes methodology\n    development and applications of adaptive\n       critic designs to automotive engine control.\nClick here for publications\n\n\n\n\n'
