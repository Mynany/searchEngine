b'In this latest research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Prof. Meenesh R. Singh at UIC and his colleagues at JCAP have developed a state-of-the-art multiscale model that brings together for the first time a quantum-chemical analysis of reaction pathway, a microkinetic model of the reaction dynamics, and a continuum model for transport of species in the electrolyte to learn precisely how carbon dioxide can be electrochemically reduced through a catalyst, in this case silver, and made into carbon monoxide. According to Prof. Singh this is one of the biggest accomplishments in electrochemistry.'
