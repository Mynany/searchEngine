b'Abstract:\xc2\xa0Spectrum sharing between radar and communicationssystems, as a means to address spectrum crunch, is an active research area.This paper considers Complex-valued Additive White Gaussian Noise (C-AWGN)communication systems co-existing with pulsed radar systems, and characterizesperformance from two angles: 1) the effect of radar interference on acommunications system is examined in terms of average error rate andconstellation design, and 2) the effect of communications interference on aradar system is examined in terms of the Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC).

b'Forthe first part, we started with a simpler single-carrier communications systeminterfered by a radar signal, where we investigated the\xc2\xa0error rateperformance and optimized a constellation based on the strength of the radarinterference power with respect to the communications power. We then extendedthe work to a more complicated multi-carrier communications system, in whichthe error rate expressions and various detectors were derived based on thecorrelation of the received signal due to the\xc2\xa0unknown\xc2\xa0'

b'For the last part, we studied thedual problem, where the ROC performance of a radar receiver with an interferingcommunications signal is analyzed. Two hypothesis testings were derived: 1) theoptimal Average Likelihood Ratio Test (ALRT) based on the Bayesian approachthat requires prior distributions of unknown parameters,\xc2\xa0and 2) thesuboptimal Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) that estimates the unknownparameters by\xc2\xa0maximum likelihood.'
