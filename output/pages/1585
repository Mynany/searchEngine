b'Thank you so much for your interest in our Mom, Me, and SWE event! SWE UIC has designed this program to promote engineering to 5th-7th grade female students who are bright, creative and enjoy hands on projects! In addition we invite Mom (or any other guardian) to partake in the fun, this way everyone learns about engineering!'
b'Registration for our\xc2\xa0Fall\xc2\xa02017 program will open in early October! Please stay tuned!'
