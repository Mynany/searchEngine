b'In the aftermath of the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia'
b'The Counseling Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago stands in opposition to discrimination, hate, and intolerance and condemns recent associated acts of violence. We are in allegiance with similar statements by University of Illinois System administration, the national organization of university counseling centers, and the American Psychological Association and other professional mental health organizations. The staff at the Counseling Center are available as a resource to any UIC student who needs us for listening, support, and advocacy to confront the negative impact that prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination have on mental health and well-being. We remain committed to the justice imperatives that are at the core of our identities as mental health professionals and members of the UIC community. We are here to help you best manage your self-care in the aftermath of recent acts of violence and to provide the freedom of a safe, confidential space in which to express your reactions and understand the ongoing development of your feelings, beliefs, and identity.'
