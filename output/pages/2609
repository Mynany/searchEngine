b'If you can crowdsource everything else, why not giraffes and zebras?'
b'To celebrate Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s wildlife heritage, the Kenyan Wildlife Service hosted a Wildlife Festival and invited anyone with a camera \xe2\x80\x94 students, citizens and wildlife enthusiasts of every stripe \xe2\x80\x94 to photograph as many zebras and giraffes as possible at the Nairobi National Park on the first two days of March. The results: more than 10,000 photos, \xe2\x80\x9ctaken by 31 teams, 75 photographers, and a bus of 40 school kids from the worst slum in east Africa who saw wild animals for the first time in their life,\xe2\x80\x9d says computational ecologist Tanya Berger-Wolf.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTheir photos will contribute to our knowledge of the ecology and conservation of the zebras and giraffes who live there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berger-Wolf, associate professor of computer science who directs the overall design of IBEIS (Image-Based Ecological Information System), software that will be used to analyze the photographs.'
b'The project will provide the final count of the number of zebras and giraffes in the park, she said.'
b'IBEIS can take collections of images from field scientists, tourists and incidental photographers \xe2\x80\x94 or gathered from camera traps, robots or drones \xe2\x80\x94 and answer queries about population size, species interactions, movement patterns and other data.'
b'The software was developed by a collaboration of scientists from UIC, Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the nonprofit WildMe.org. It can detect various species of animals in photo images and identify individual animals \xe2\x80\x9cof most striped, spotted, wrinkled or notched species \xe2\x80\x94 much like recognizing a person by a fingerprint,\xe2\x80\x9d Berger-Wolf said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIBEIS stores information about who the animals are, where and when they are there, and provides tools that scientists and curious people can use to find out what those animals are doing and why they are doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d Such information, she said, can \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a great tool for basic science and for improving management and conservation of animals.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'IBEIS uses images to answer queries about population size, species interactions, movement patterns and other data.'
b'IBEIS was piloted at the Mpala Research Centre and Ol\xe2\x80\x99Pejeta Nature Conservancy in Kenya. The first full prototype was deployed last month at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya. Princeton University ecologist Daniel Rubenstein directs the biological aspects of IBEIS design and deployment.'
b'Charles Stewart, computer vision scientist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, oversees the image analysis engine for individual animal identification, based on the foundation of his software HotSpotter. Jason Holmberg, a data management expert with WildMe.org, created the WildBook, which powers the IBEIS data management system.'
b'Support for IBEIS development has been provided by the National Science Foundation, Microsoft Research and private donations.'
