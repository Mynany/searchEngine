b'NSF funded report focuses on classroom technology'
b'\n\t\t\t\tNovember 7, 2017\t\t\t'
b'A new report co-authored by a University of Illinois at Chicago computer and learning scientist examines\xc2\xa0the use of technology in classrooms through efforts supported by the National Science Foundation.'
b''
b'Organized by The Center for Innovative Research in Cyberlearning, or CIRCL, the report highlights examples of the work that the cyberlearning community is engaged in to integrate the latest innovations in learning science and computer science into new research designs and methods.'
b'Tom Moher, UIC associate professor of computer science and learning sciences, is one of 22 members of the U.S. cyberlearning community who wrote the report, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\xc2\xa0Cyberlearning Community Report: The State of Cyberlearning and the Future of Learning With Technology,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0which features six design themes emerging across multiple NSF-funded cyberlearning projects taking place in classrooms from pre-K-12 through post-secondary levels.'
b'Among the questions tackled in the report are:'
b'Moher, whose research has included work\xc2\xa0with Chicago and suburban elementary and middle schools, started on the project as a faculty member in the College of Engineering\xe2\x80\x99s computer science department and later continued as an emeritus faculty member in the Learning Sciences Research Institute in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.'
b'Moher coauthored a section of the report, \xe2\x80\x9cClassrooms as Digital Performance Spaces,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 with Noel Enyedy of UCLA. The section featured research that took place at UIC under several NSF grants on which Moher served as principal investigator. Research at UIC\xc2\xa0 involving this work stretches back to 2003.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNew technologies open the door to radically new genres of learning activities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Moher.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis report paints a future that goes beyond today\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98apps\xe2\x80\x99 and engages learners with new interaction paradigms that make learning both engaging and fruitful. It\xe2\x80\x99s an exciting time to\xc2\xa0be doing research at the intersection of computer science and the learning sciences.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'This is the first \xe2\x80\x9creport to the community\xe2\x80\x9d around NSF\xe2\x80\x99s investment in learning technologies, according to Moher.'
