b'Earth and environmental scientists explore dynamic processes that occur from molecular to global scales and which, over geologic time, have shaped our planet as we know it today.\xc2\xa0 Our understanding of Earth processes provides essential information on critical natural resources like water, air, and soil; the materials needed for innovative construction, manufacturing, and technology; and the framework for exploring other planets, moons, and beyond.\xc2\xa0 Our environment \xe2\x80\x93 the Earth system we live in and depend on \xe2\x80\x93 is increasingly being altered by human activity, bringing a new and urgent dimension to the discipline.'
b'Careers in Earth and environmental science are many. The American Geosciences Institute predicts a serious shortage of trained workers, estimated at 135,000, in our field over the next decade.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 16% increase in jobs in geoscience fields and a 15% increase in jobs in environmental science fields, higher than the overall average growth of 11% for all occupations in the United States.'
b'EaES faculty apply expertise in geochemistry, geobiology, and geophysics to study processes in the atmosphere, at Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s interior, and on other planetary bodies. Our research involves field work around the globe, laboratory investigations on campus and at national facilities, and computational modeling. The research of our faculty and students is integrated into the classroom. \nWe invite you to explore our site to learn about the educational and research opportunities we offer to Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) students in Earth and Environmental Sciences.'
