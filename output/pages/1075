b'CubePro Trio'
b'Our CubePro Trio from 3D Systems is capable of printing three materials at a time, however in practice we only print two materials: Nylon and PVA supports.'
b'Slicing is done with Simplify3D and we need stl files. The meshes should be designed with minimal overhangs and there must be a large, flat base \xe2\x80\x93 nylon is less forgiving than PLA on these things.'
b'The print area is roughly 10\xe2\x80\xb3 by 10\xe2\x80\xb3 but depending on which print heads are used the print volume can shrink.'
b'There is no choice of color on this machine.'
