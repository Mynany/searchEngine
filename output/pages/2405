b'Ordering food online can get expensive quickly when you add the delivery fee and tip to the total. Unless the order is placed through the online app Chowbus, a Chicago-based tech startup that charges a modest $1 for deliveries.'
b'Co-founded by UIC alumnus Suyu Zhang, who serves as the company\xe2\x80\x99s chief technology officer, Chowbus curates and delivers top-notch ethnic food with a rotating menu. The company started selling food online in 2015. Zhang has a background in mobile apps and he and the co-founder started working on their app, which was launched in March of 2016. Now, they are generating approximately $600,000 a month. The idea for a low delivery fee came from personal experiences ordering food while Zhang was working on his master\xe2\x80\x99s degree. \xc2\xa0'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were in school and ordered food, the delivery fees were too high,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zhang. \xe2\x80\x9cFor an $8 sandwich, I had to pay an extra $6 or $7 delivery fee plus tips. I felt like this was something we could improve, because it was too expensive. So we came up with the idea to group the orders together, so we can deliver the orders in groups.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'They set up hundreds of pickup locations in the Chicago area, with most in the downtown area. When someone places an order, they also select a pickup location, and every day at the same time they can go to that location to pick up food for lunch.'
b'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a bus with a route, and we have about 20 routes in Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zhang. \xe2\x80\x9cEach route has different pickup locations or what we call a \xe2\x80\x98stop.\xe2\x80\x99 The driver goes through the same route and to the same stop to deliver the food. Since it is operated like a bus, each stop delivery time is guaranteed. Just like a bus.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Unlike a regular bus, the Chowbus will be at each stop for approximately 15 minutes, which gives customers plenty of time to pick up their order. This allows multiple people from an area to order and pick up food at a designated location and a designated time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of this is that we can lower the delivery fee to only $1 and still make money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zhang, who noted that they offer door-to-door service which comes with a higher delivery fee. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to pay a tip since you are picking up the food.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Drive to Succeed at UIC  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s road to success started at UIC, where he earned a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering studying under the direction of ECE Professor Zhichun Zhu.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSuyu worked with me as a student for about two years. He was a good student and published a conference paper with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zhu. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to hear about his success.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a good experience. The professor always taught me how to improve the code to make the experiments faster,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zhang about working in her laboratory. \xe2\x80\x9cI learned the programing skills in classes and I got help from professors. Before I took those classes, I had no idea how much I liked this work. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know I liked mobile development.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Apart from his inspiring experience with Professor Zhu, he enjoyed his time at UIC and recommends it to potential students. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cECE has good resources and the teachers are really professional. Also Chicago is really nice and the location of UIC is really good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great experience.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'According to Zhang, Chicago is a great place for a startup company like Chowbus. Aside from the hungry lunch crowds looking for a unique meal, big tech companies are paying attention to the Chowbus. The company recently raised $1.06 million in fundraising.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0'
b'The team of 12 employees are moving to a bigger office now that they have outgrown their current location. Additionally, they recently launched the app in Boston and plan to expand to two more cities by the end of 2018.'
