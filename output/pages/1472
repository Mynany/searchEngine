b'The mission of the Richard and Loan Hill Department of Bioengineering is to create an environment where its students can learn the principles of safely applying engineering technology to living systems. The interdisciplinary course of study provides a thorough understanding of engineering, physical science and biological principles that will prepare its graduates for careers in the biomedical industry, admission to top graduate programs, and acceptance in a variety of professional schools (medicine, dentistry, nursing and pharmacy). The UIC Department of Bioengineering has unique resources because of its close affiliation with the clinical and research programs of the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago and the opportunities to intern at major biomedical manufacturers (Abbott, Baxter, Biomet, General Electric, and Siemens, for example) in the Chicago and northwest Indiana areas. Students can easily work at facilities on campus or in the adjoining Illinois Technology Park. Senior design projects, co-op assignments, or academic year internships can also be conducted in Chicagoland biomedical industries.'
