b'\xe2\x80\x9cSide channels in multi-tenant environments\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Abstract:'
b'Due to the massive adoption of computing platforms that consolidate potentially distrustful tenants\xe2\x80\x99 applications on common hardware\xe2\x80\x94both large (e.g., public clouds) and small (e.g., smartphones)\xe2\x80\x94the security provided by these platforms to their tenants is increasingly being scrutinized.\xc2\xa0In this talk we will review highlights from the last several years of research on a long-suspected but, until recently, largely hypothetical attack vector on such platforms, namely side-channel attacks.\xc2\xa0 In these attacks, one tenant learns sensitive information about another tenant simply by running on the same hardware with it, but without violating the logical access control enforced by the platform\xe2\x80\x99s isolation software (virtual machine monitor or operating system). We will then summarize various strategies we have explored to defend against side-channel attacks in their various forms, both inexpensive defenses against specific attacks and more holistic but expensive protections.'
