b'\nSWE is a great support group for all engineering students at UIC! We coordinate many events throughout the academic year that range from attending conferences to conducting outreach events for elementary school students. We focus on academic and professional development so our fellow students feel prepared for graduate school and/or the workforce. We strive to provide our members with many different resources including scholarships and the opportunity to attend national and regional conferences every year. At these conferences, students are able to network with other future engineers and even attend career fairs which is a great way to find internships and full time employment.'
b'We have general body meetings every other week during the Fall and Spring semesters and even offer volunteer opportunities to promote STEM to younger students. Through our Mom, Me, and SWE events, we invite female elementary school students and their parents to visit our campus to partake in fun engineering projects. This is a great way to introduce young girls to engineering and strengthen our relationship with local schools. There is no doubt that SWE members at UIC are provided with many leadership and networking opportunities and we believe these are vital skills for any career!'
b'We hope to see you at our future events!'
