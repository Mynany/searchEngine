b'The UIC Transit Benefit Program allows benefit eligible employees to pay their commuting expenses through payroll deductions. The program works with the Ventra card for the CTA and offers Commuter Check Transit Mastercard. The Commuter Check Transit MasterCard may be used for transportation expenditures on Pace, South Shore Railroad, and Metra. It also allows the user to add/transfer funds on to their Ventra cards/accounts.'

b'MasterCard (Monthly)Distribution'
