b"\n\nNomination Content\n\n\nApplicants must provide the information below in the order as outlined.\nCover Page form - This is an online fillable form. It is not downloadable. You should complete this last when you are ready to submit your application online. \xc2\xa0\nNarrative Statement form \xe2\x80\x93 This should be downloaded and completed by the nominator. Note:\nNominations will be reviewed by multidisciplinary panels so care should be taken to explain achievements in a way that can be appreciated by non-specialists in the field. For example, consider providing context for the individual\xe2\x80\x99s publication record, such as the typical number of publications for the given career stage, the prestige of the journals, conventions for authorship in the individual\xe2\x80\x99s (sub)field, etc. Make clear how the individual\xe2\x80\x99s work compares to what is typical for someone in his/her (sub)field and career stage.\nFor Distinguished awards, nominators should describe the impact of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s work over his/her career, with a focus on one or two accomplishments and major breakthroughs achieved within the past three years. Nominators may also describe how these research accomplishments have contributed to the research excellence at UIC.\nFor Rising Star awards, nominators should describe the impact of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s work so far, with a focus on potential to become a leader in his/her field in the relatively near future. Nominators may also describe the potential impact on research excellence at UIC.\nStatement should be 2 pages in length, single-spaced, 12-point font, with 1-inch margins.\n\nNominee\xe2\x80\x99s curriculum vitae or resume. Items to include as appropriate to the nominee\xe2\x80\x99s field of research:\nFor Rising Star nominees, date of PhD or other terminal degree;\nInclude the dates and type of appointment for all listed institutions;\nList of completed, current and pending extramural research/scholarly support with a 1- 2 sentence description \xe2\x80\x93 including total project cost \xe2\x80\x93 of each project and the nominee\xe2\x80\x99s role in the project (i.e. principal investigator, co-principal investigator);\nPresentation of research/scholarship in professional settings such as a conference speaker/lecturer (please indicate keynote, plenary, or invited) or installation/exhibit;\nList of relevant publications (within the past 10 years);\nList of outreach and engaged/public scholarship.\n\t\tNote: The resume/CV may not exceed 4 pages.\n\nTwo letters of support from individuals other than the nominator who are familiar with the nominee\xe2\x80\x99s research/scholarship and who have expertise necessary for judging the nominee\xe2\x80\x99s contributions. Writers should note their relationship to the nominee. \xc2\xa0\nLetters can be either internal or external to UIC; however, reviewers tend to value external letters, especially for Distinguished Researcher nominees. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nAlthough letters can come from former or current collaborators, reviewers tend to expect letters from impartial leaders in the field who have not collaborated with the nominee \xe2\x80\x93 this is especially true for Distinguished Researcher nominees. \xc2\xa0\nEach letter of support should be no more than 2 pages in length, single-spaced, 12-point font, with 1-inch margins.\n\nOPTIONAL - No more than 5 pages of other materials supporting the candidate's achievements, e.g., press clippings, award announcements, or news items.\n\nSummary of nomination package\n\n\nCover page\n\n\nOnline fillable form (complete last)\n\n\nNarrative statement\n\n\n2 pages, single-spaced, 12 point font, with 1-inch margins\n\n\nNominee CV\n\n\n4 pages\n\n\nLetter of support\n\n\n2 pages, single-spaced, 12 point font, with 1-inch margins\n\n\nLetter of support\n\n\n2 pages, single-spaced, 12 point font, with 1-inch margins\n\n\nOptional supporting materials\n\n\nUp to 5 pages\n\n\nAny components exceeding the prescribed page limits will be truncated before review.\n\n\n"
