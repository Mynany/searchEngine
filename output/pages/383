b'Negative Decisions'
b'Receiving a negative decision is never easy, but you can trust that our decision was reached only after multiple, thorough reviews of your application, essays, recommendations, transcripts, and test scores.'
b'If you received a negative decision, you may consider applying for a later term. Keep in mind that completing the recommended number of credit hours and prerequisite coursework listed in our\xc2\xa0transfer guide\xc2\xa0will improve your chances of being admitted as a transfer student. We typically receive more applications than spaces available but the applicant pool varies from term to term.\xc2\xa0Visit the\xc2\xa0transfer requirements\xc2\xa0page for more details.\xc2\xa0'
