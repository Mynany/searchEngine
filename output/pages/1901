b'Research'
b'My research interests span several areas of security and privacy. In the past\nfew years I have focused on understanding the security limitations of online\nsocial networks and web services, exploring the privacy threats that users\nface, and designing robust countermeasures. I\xe2\x80\x99m also interested in the\nshortcomings of authentication mechanisms and the robustness of bot-prevention\nmechanisms. Ultimately my research focuses on better understanding the Web\xe2\x80\x99s\nthreat landscape and securing users.'
