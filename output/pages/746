b'Student Leadership and Civic Engagement invited community organizations to campus to participate in Involvement Fair on September 5 and 6. Joining student organizations, campus departments, vendors, and more, non-profit organizations that were looking to recruit UIC student volunteers spent their time talking about their mission and ways that students can contribute. Volunteering with an off-campus community organization can be a great way to contribute to the community, take action around issues that are important to you, and learn important skills.'
