ADVIS hosts\nstudents doing research in computer information management systems with particular emphasis on database and information\nsystems and related issues such as: semantic\nweb (and in particular semantic\ndata integration and semantic\ndesktop), geospatial information\nsystems, context-aware systems, information visualization (including graph drawing), retrieval\nand presentation of multimedia information, and information\nretrieval and classification.\nThis research lab has existed since 1994 (first with the name DBVIS, for Database\nVisualization) and after 1997\nwith the current name, reflecting the fact that we focus on all types of information and not only on information\nthat can be stored in and retrieved from traditional database systems. The group has comprised several PhD, MS,\nand BS students collaborating in research and publishing papers in competitive international conferences and in\njournals. Over the years, the group has regularly sponsored the visit of several leading US and European researchers\nand of postdocs.\n\nGroup Activities\nSend email to advis@cs.uic.edu, if you would like to receive\nemail notices concerning group meetings and other ADVIS-related news.\nGroup Members\nThe group is led by Professor\nIsabel Cruz. There are several students,\npostdocs, and visitors involved in research. See available positions, if you would like to join\nthe lab. Check the page on graduation rules for writing suggestions and deadlines.\nExternal Funding\nThe group has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Department of\nDefense, NATO, CRA, and corporate gifts.\nPublications\n\nSome of our recent papers (with links to the actual papers) can be found in the\n\tADVIS publications page.\n\tList of the topics of research of the group with references to some of the papers.\nList of the publications\n\tsponsored by an NSF ITR by my colleagues, myself, and our students.\nA partial list of publications by members of the group can\n\tbe found in the excellent DBLP\n\tBibliography Database, by Michael Ley.\n\nProjects\nThe group is currently working on six projects:\n\nData Interoperability for Geospatial ApplicationsTThis project integrates and extends Computer Science research in the Database Management\n\tSystem (DBMS) area with a State of Wisconsin Land Information System (WLIS). Web-based DBMS user interface, search,\n\tand query techniques will be incorporated in WLIS. The concept of WLIS as a statewide access mechanism for land\n\trelated data in Wisconsin has been actively under development for several years by a working group that includes\n\tvarious levels of government and the University of Wisconsin. WLIS will be a distributed Web-based system with\n\theterogeneous data residing on local and state servers. A large part of WLIS is spatial, Geographic Information\n\tSystems (GIS) data. Collaborating institutions: UIC (lead) and University of Wisconsin-Madison. (Paper)\nCASSIS: Context-Aware Computing\n\twith Applications to Public Health Management This project creates\n\tan architecture for a system that provides comprehensive support for context-aware applications. More than 130\n\tpublications have resulted from this project among collaborating institutions UIC (lead), Brown University\n\tand Northwestern University. The current research emphasis by the ADVIS group is on an extension to a role-based\n\taccess control (RBAC) approach to provide for the dynamic association of roles with users in collaborative environments.\n\t(Paper)\nSemantic Desktop With the Semantic\n\tWeb vision, a number of Personal Information Management Systems have been proposed [Web page for the 1st Workshop on the Semantic Desktop].\n\tIn our approach, we propose: (1) Semantic data organization based on multiple layers of ontologies; (2) Flexible\n\tdata manipulation provided by data interoperation and supported by an expressive query language; and (3) Rich visual\n\tmanipulation that uses the underlying semantic connections among data. (Paper)\nEfficient\n\tMatching for Large Real-World Schemas and Ontologies This project\n\textends the state of the art in schema and ontology matching, and therefore in data integration, by testing and\n\tevaluating methods and strategies that establish relationships among semantically related concepts in heterogeneous\n\tdata sources.\n\tThe following research issues are addressed: (1) Design of methods and algorithms for schema and ontology matching\n\tthat operate at different levels of granularity (e.g., concept, structure); (2) Development of a prototype of an\n\tintegrated system that supports the visualization and manipulation of large schemas and ontologies in addition\n\tto the developed matching methods and algorithms; (3) Test and evaluation of the above methods and system prototype\n\tin terms of their effectiveness, including accuracy (precision, recall) and efficiency (execution time). (Paper)\nPrivacy-preserving record and image mapping\n\tIn this project we consider methods to perform record and image mapping in a privacy preserving way, more specifically,\n\twe will develop mapping procedures with privacy guarantees for the parties involved in the mapping process. Quality\n\tmeasures will be developed and uncertainty will be considered. Collaborating institutions: UIC (lead), Brown University,\n\tRutgers University, University of Rome "La Sapienza." (Preliminary paper)\nQuery Languages for Heterogeneous Transportation Networks We are exploring textual and visual query languages for graphs that represent urban transportation networks.\n\tIssues to explore include the syntax and semantics of the languages, their expressive power and query evaluation.\n\tThis project is part of an IGERT grant at UIC. (Paper)\n\nOther projects of the group:\n\nVisualization and Integration of Heterogeneous Information (DelaunayMM and\n\tDelaunayViewsystems)\nThis system tightly integrates a visual query language for distributed queries\n\twith the layout specification that can emphasize the information semantics. We are continuing this work in several\n\tdirections, including the use of ontologies to aid in query refinement, the integration of security concerns, and\n\tthe creation of metadata for the synchronized retrieval and presentation of the information.\nVisual Query Languages (Delaunay system)M\nThe basis of this system is a visual meta-query language for displaying and querying\n\tobject-oriented databases, called DOODLE. Features of the system include the support of user defined query languages\n\tand visualizations. Currently we are continuing work on: (1) semi-automatic visualizations; (2) use of metadata\n\tto generate visualizations; and (3) using dynamic constraint solving for positioning optional visual components.\n\nPANDA (Publishing Assistant for Networked\n\tDocument Assembly)\nThis project is on a powerful authoring tool that integrates and presents marked-up\n\tinformation that is available on the web and gives powerful customization capabilities to the users (publishers\n\tand end-users). The result of this research is being directly incorporated into the ACM SIGMOD Digital Symposium\n\tCollection. We are extending PANDA to incorporate: visual query languages and metadata support.\n\n\nCASA (Classification using a Structural\n\tApproach)\nWe have been investigating automatic classification of Web documents. We studied\n\tthe recall based on the structural analysis of more than 600,000 Web documents. We are investigating new algorithms\n\tthat improve recall.\n\n\nMATIC (Multimedia Authoring with\n\tTime Constraints)\nThis is a multimedia authoring project for the temporal synchronization of multimedia\n\tstreams. We have devised an efficient algorithm that determines whether synchronization can be achieved. Future\n\twork includes integrating this approach into SMIL.\n\n\nMocha\nThis project optimally partitions the software components of a typical algorithm\n\tanimation system and leverages the power of the Java language. This system is currently used for geometric algorithms\n\t(with the Computational Geometry Center at Brown U.).\n\n\nWebSA (Web Site Agent)\nIn this project users upon entering a Web site are given hints reflecting the\n\tinterests of the previous thousands of visits to the site. In order to take into account the information previously\n\tgathered, efficient database mining of the previously collected data and the building of relevant aggregate information\n\tare performed. We are developing other collaborative filtering algorithms within the same architecture.\n\n\nACM DiSC\nUntil 2001 the lab was "home" to the ACM SIGMOD Digital Symposium Collection (DiSC),\n\tan electronic journal that is the most extensive yearly source of database publications.\n\nCollaborating Institutions\n\nInformation Security Group at Brown University\nDatabase Systems Group at Northwestern University\nLand Information and Computing Graphics Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison\nDatabase and User Interface Group at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" (Italy)\nInternational Doctorate School in Information\n\tand Communication Technologies at the University of Modena and Reggio\n\tEmilia (Italy)\n\nRelated Links\n\nThe Database and\n\tInformation Systems Research Group at UIC\nThe Department\n\tof Computer Science\nThe School\n\tof Engineering\nThe University\n\tof Illinois at Chicago (UIC)\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\n\nMembers\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nCollaborations\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nIsabel F.
