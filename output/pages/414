b'In 1997 a new international initiative began at the College of Engineering.\xc2\xa0 Professor Piergiorgio\xc2\xa0Uslenghi of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Dept (as it was then known)\xc2\xa0launched a contract MS degree program with the Politecnico di Torino, one of the most highly\xc2\xa0regarded technical universities in Italy. This program allowed Politecnico students to take a\xc2\xa0semester of UIC course work at the Politecnico, and then finish the MS degree work in\xc2\xa0residence at UIC for one or more semesters. Each student in the program is required to have a\xc2\xa0faculty advisor at both institutions, and to defend a master\xe2\x80\x99s thesis at UIC. Since 1999, over 120\xc2\xa0EECS/ECE students have graduated from Politecnico di\xc2\xa0Torino/UIC contract program with a\xc2\xa0Master of Science degree. Nearly all of the faculty in the ECE department have advised students\xc2\xa0in the program at one time or another. The program has been a resounding success from both a\xc2\xa0student and faculty perspective, allowing for research collaborations between institutions,\xc2\xa0Ph.D. applicants for UIC, and valuable research and corporate work experience in the U.S. for\xc2\xa0international students.'
