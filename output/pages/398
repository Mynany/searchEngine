b'The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers programs leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, and Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.'
b' Both of the engineering degree programs are fully accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).'
b' In addition, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers a degree program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics.  Engineering Physics is accredited by the Illinois Board of Higher Education.'
b'The UIC College of Engineering admits students during the Fall, Spring and Summer terms. They admit students who are beginning Freshmen (directly out of High School) and transfer students (Junior standing). Students seeking admission to the College of Engineering who are recent high school graduates or who have earned less than 12 semester hours (18 quarter hours) of credit at another collegiate institution are classified as new freshman and must meet the entrance requirements to the College that are specified for new freshmen. The College of Engineering recommends that each new freshman complete a strong high school mathematics curriculum that includes algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.'
b' The College will give admission priority to residents of the State of Illinois. Applicants who are not residents of the State of Illinois may be admitted only after review by the College.'
b'Request Admissions Information'
b' You may request undergraduate admissions information on-line, through UIC\'s Office of Admissions and Records. Select "Engineering" as your choice of Programs.
