b'\n\tLimitations of traditional 2D Culture / Why do Drugs Fail?\r\n\tPotential of 3D Culture / Why to use 3D Matrices for Drug Development & Discovery?\r\n\tTypes of 3D Culture Systems / 3D Matrices.\r\n\tTechniques of 3D scaffold fabrication: Electrospinning, Gas-Foaming, 3D Printing, hanging-drop scaffolds. NO "exact 1:1 replication"!!!  \r\nNone of those fabricated scaffolds are similar to the actual 3D structures in nature. \r\n\r\n\tTissue Engineering\r\n\tAdvantages & Applications of 3D Culture\r\n\n\nFig.1. Drug discovery and development is an expensive process.\nIt costs the pharmaceutical industry on an average $2.6 billion (including the cost of failures) and more than 10 years to develop a new drug. Each year, on average of 25 novel drugs are approved by the FDA\'s CDER and approximately $51.2 billion was spent in the year of 2014 by the pharmaceutical industry on research and development.\r\n\r\n\n\nFig.2 Currently most of the standard screening procedures are dependent on animal testing or in vivo testing. The problem with this is that animals react differently to drugs as opposed to human reaction and we cannot accurately predict its effects on humans. Animal testing is extremely expensive and a time-consuming pre-clinical process which provides inaccurate results. Even though animal testing might be successful and promising, it may eventually result in the compound failing in late-stage clinical trials. \nResearchers and regulatory organizations across the globe are pushing for alternative methods for in vivo testing. Thus, in vitro cell-based assays are beginning to replace the in vivo animal testing thereby providing more accurate data.\r\n. '

b'The fabrication of scaffolds for drug discovery using 3D electron-beam lithography (Fig. 4 and 5) is an innovative concept and a potential break-through idea which could possibly be a paradigm shift in the drug-testing process. \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.4. The state-of-the-art 3-D Nano-fabrication could be achieved by modulating the Electron-Beam Lithography exposure dose\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the traditional 2D cell culture (Fig.2) does not accurately mimic the 3D environment in which cells reside, it may provide inaccurate data regarding the predicted response of cells to therapeutics. \r\n\r\nIn vitro cell-based assays, our 3D fabricated scaffolds have the potential to replace in vivo animal testing and provide more reliable data. \r\n\r\n\r\n'
