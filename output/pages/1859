In addition to calling or stopping by the Counseling Center to make an appointment or using our InTouch Hotline, we also offer the following relevant resources for emotional support and resilience building:\nThe American Psychological Association Help Center offers sound advice for those coping either from afar or more directly with this late summer\xe2\x80\x99s hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes: http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/disaster-articles.aspx'

b'Among those materials is this relevant excerpt:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile millions face the direct impact of the storms and flames, countless others face emotional responses as they look on with both worry and sympathy.\xc2\xa0Dealing with hurricanes from afar\xc2\xa0produces traumatic distress even for those not directly affected. Maintaining a sense of perspective, acknowledging your feelings and looking for ways to help in the recovery effort can be effective tools for coping. The same advice holds for\xc2\xa0distress caused by distant earthquakes; read the article for information on how psychologists can help.\nOf course, waters will eventually recede, and fires will eventually die out. But it\xe2\x80\x99s important to deal with the emotional aftermath.\xc2\xa0Recovering emotionally from disaster\xc2\xa0involves providing time to adjust, seeking support from loved ones and sharing your experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d'
