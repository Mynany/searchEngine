b'Spark lights up Pavilion'

b'Splor and Travis Scott had nothing in common before Spark in the Park Sept. 1. Afterward, however, both can say they rocked the UIC Pavilion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be interesting because we are kind of the exact opposite of Travis Scott,\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Dombro, a senior in economics and lead singer of Splor, said hours before taking the stage.'
b'That they were.'
b'Splor, winner of the 2016 Battle of the Bands event hosted by UIC Radio, hit leadoff in Spark 2016\xe2\x80\x99s order and played rock songs that engaged a crowd that came mostly for two rappers. The genuine elation and modesty Splor expressed through song-transition \xe2\x80\x9cthank yous\xe2\x80\x9d brought cheers from the UIC audience.'
b'While Scott forgot his \xe2\x80\x9cthank yous\xe2\x80\x9d at Hallmark, his set was as wild as advertised.'
b'The rapper delivered his typical high-energy performance that makes his shows must-see.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cScott was well worth the wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shanice Kloss, a junior in economics. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom start to finish he was pumped up.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAntidote,\xe2\x80\x9d which rose to No. 16 on Billboard\xe2\x80\x99s Hot 100, was belted by nearly every crowd member on the floor, but the most creative part of Scott\xe2\x80\x99s theatre may have been his nod to Chicago.'
b'To the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure, Scott rapped and danced to Kanye West\xe2\x80\x99s hit, \xe2\x80\x9cFather Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he performed the late Speaker Knockerz\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cLonely.\xe2\x80\x9d While Speaker Knockerz wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raised in Chicago, his sound resonated all over the city because of the drill components.'
b'It would be remiss not to mention the way Alex Corral of Nexus & Aztro ignited the crowd during his set. Corral, performing by himself, proved why he won UIC\xe2\x80\x99s last DJ Battle by reading the audience\xe2\x80\x99s vibe and spinning to it.'
b'Daya and Young Thug also commanded the Pavilion stage. While Daya gave the community a surprise taste of her new music, Young Thug, also known as Jeffery, played through the hits. His rendition of \xe2\x80\x9cLifestyle\xe2\x80\x9d was fire.'
b'At the end, the UIC community walked out the doors having heard diverse sound from all genres.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOverall, Spark was awesome this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Kloss said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a little disappointed when they decided to move it to the Pavilion, but the performances were really good.\xe2\x80\x9d'
