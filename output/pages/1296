b'THE CIVIL ENGINEERING PROFESSIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL'
b'The Civil Engineering Professional Advisory Council (CEPAC) was established at UIC in 2000, and consists of civil engineering faculty members and professional practitioners. The purpose of CEPAC is to enhance undergraduate education at CME through close interactions with the professional civil engineering community. Similar organizations exist in other engineering departments and at other schools. CEPAC members are leaders from the environmental, geotechnical, structures, transportation and water resources\xc2\xa0fields. They are representatives of private companies and governmental agencies throughout\xc2\xa0the Chicago region.'
