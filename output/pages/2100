b'From NBC News:\nby Jason Abbruzzese, Ben Popken and David Ingram'
b'SAN FRANCISCO \xe2\x80\x94 The\xc2\xa0security issue Facebook announced on Friday\xc2\xa0has alarmed researchers who say attackers collected information that not only gave access to sensitive information on Facebook, but also could be used to access many websites that use the social network\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLogin with Facebook\xe2\x80\x9d function.'
b'Facebook revealed that unnamed attackers were able to exploit a series of flaws to collect \xe2\x80\x9caccess tokens\xe2\x80\x9d for 50 million accounts. Those tokens, Facebook said, would allow attackers to take over profiles and theoretically access any information therein. It has not announced how many of those 50 million accounts were accessed or what if any information was taken since the account tokens were first exposed 14 months ago.'
b'But security researchers are warning users to be on alert for suspicious activity \xe2\x80\x94 on and off Facebook.'
b'The tokens could have been used to create or access accounts with companies that use Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLogin with Facebook\xe2\x80\x9d function, which allows people to sign up for various websites and services with their Facebook profiles.'
b'Jason Polakis, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said Facebook users should check their connected apps for any accounts they had not signed up for.'
