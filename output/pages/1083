b'We have one BOSSLASER HP2436 laser cutter at the MakerSpace. This Laser Cutter can cut and engrave a variety of materials. The bed is 24\xc3\x9736 inches long and the maximum cutting thickness is roughly 1/2 an inch \xe2\x80\x93 although we can accomodate objects that are much thicker.'
b'The laser cutter is extremely fast compared to 3d printing and the parts are much stronger. It is to your benefit to use the laser when appropriate.'
