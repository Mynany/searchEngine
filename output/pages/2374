b'The late Dr. Harold A. Simon was a UIC professor of mechanical engineering renowned for his teaching excellence. In 1985, as a memorial to Dr. Simon, an award recognizing teaching excellence was established by the College of Engineering. One award is presented each year to a faculty member who exemplifies the dedication, distinguished service, and teaching excellence that were the hallmarks of the late Dr. Simon\xe2\x80\x99s career. Congratulations to Professor Preimer for winning this distinguished award. Those who have been his students, however, are not at all surprised that he was the winner!'
