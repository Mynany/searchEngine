b'MLK Day of Service 2019 Registration Form'
b'The Dr. MLK Jr. Day of Service takes place on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day every January. Since there is no class held on this day, we characterize it as \xe2\x80\x9ca day on, not a day off\xe2\x80\x9d.'
b"Each year, approximately 150 students, faculty, staff, and friends of the UIC community participate in honoring Dr. King's legacy by serving our local communities."
