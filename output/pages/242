b'Networking'
b'Networking is part of a successful job search strategy. Building a strong network of professional contacts now will help you throughout your career!'
b'Networking Tips'
b'What is networking?'
b'Networking is simply a word to describe connecting with people in your chosen professional field. It\xe2\x80\x99s a process of developing professional relationships that will help you grow your career.'
b'You probably network regularly without realizing it (e.g. speaking with professors about your career goals, meeting a recruiter at a career fair and following up with a LinkedIn connection request, or asking a friend\xe2\x80\x99s parent who\xe2\x80\x99s also an engineer about how they got into engineering).'
b'Why is networking important?'
b'Believe it or not, as many as 80% of new jobs are never posted online; they\xe2\x80\x99re obtained through networking. That means that a majority of your job searching time should be spent networking.'
b'as many as 80% of new jobs are never posted online'
b'Is it weird or inappropriate to approach strangers to ask for help?'
b'Not at all! Most working professionals have obtained at least one job or internship through networking. Engineers and other professionals have been in your shoes before, and some will be happy to help you. Not everyone will be receptive or have time to give you advice, so, if one person can\xe2\x80\x99t provide the information you want, move on to someone else.'
b'Where and with whom can I network?'
b'Your network is a lot bigger than you think. Anybody you have ever met is part of your network. \xc2\xa0Family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, professors, and classmates. People who interview you are part of your network. Even some people you have never met are part of your network, including UIC alumni. The amount of networking opportunities available to you are only limited by your willingness and ability to simply talk to people.'
b'UIC alumni'
b'You can network at real-time events (including career fairs, trade shows, networking-focused happy hour events, student org meetings, Career Center employer events) or virtually over email and LinkedIn. Check out events both on- and off-campus to talk to people who are working in your desired field(s).'
b'How can I be a successful networker?'
b'How can I network virtually?'
b'For networking virtually through email or LinkedIn:'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Sample Message sent through a LinkedIn connection request:'
b'Hi {NAME},'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m an engineering student at UIC thinking about my overall career path. I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in {INDUSTRY} and want to network with professionals in your field. I saw that you went to UIC for engineering as well! Would you be open to a conversation with me about what you do at {COMPANY NAME} and how you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten there?'
