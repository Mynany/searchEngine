b'What kind of service will future 5G wireless networks need to provide to users?'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s one question Daniela Tuninetti aims to answer in her research.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re working on what will happen in about 10 years from now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tuninetti, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re already thinking of what you might want from your phone, how much data you might need and how we should design better performing networks.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tuninetti studies the mathematics behind communications networks and how these networks can be improved for optimal performance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cInformation Theory, my main field of research, provides a benchmark against which any practical technology should be compared,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re far from that benchmark, then aspects of the design need to be improved.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Another aspect of Tuninetti\xe2\x80\x99s research applies electrical engineering principles to medical applications. She is collaborating with UIC College of Medicine professor Konstantin Slavin and UIC engineering professor Daniel Graupe to develop technology for on-demand deep brain stimulation to reduce tremor symptoms in patients with Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s disease or essential tremor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnce these devices are implanted, the brain stimulation is constant over time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a proof of concept that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to switch off that stimulation for a certain period of time and patients are still having some of the good benefits of the stimulation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kind of technology we develop figures out when the tremor is about to reappear and switches stimulation on again. It is envisioned to have applications well beyond tremor disorders.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Turning off the constant stimulation has its benefits, she said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese devices have batteries so if you use the stimulation half of the time, you will maybe have less surgeries for battery replacements,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome symptoms are also sometimes made worse by the stimulation, such as speech.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tuninetti is collaborating with UIC engineering professors Natasha Devroye and Danilo Erricolo as well as a professor at Purdue University to answer a critical problem addressed in the 2012 report of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. They received a grant from the National Science Foundation to study whether wireless data networks can share the spectrum with radar systems, which are used for airplane tracking, for example.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf they coexist in the same bandwidth, how much interference would they cause one another?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have radar that misses some of the planes. We are trying to figure out how much performance will be downgraded by having the two systems share the same spectrum, then put solutions in place.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tuninetti also teaches a mix of undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI really strive to make sure students understand the basic concepts \xe2\x80\x94 that they see the impact of technology today but also see beyond them because they need to be able to see what\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re already searching for the next thing. You should be able to imagine things that don\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tuninetti joined UIC in 2005, after receiving her master\xe2\x80\x99s in telecommunication engineering in Turin, Italy, and Ph.D. in electrical engineering in Paris, France, then working as a post-doctoral research associate in Lausanne, Switzerland.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for a faculty position worldwide,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had lived many places in Europe, so I thought \xe2\x80\x98Why not go to the U.S.?\xe2\x80\x99'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI really enjoy working with my colleagues in this department; there\xe2\x80\x99s good mentoring and support when you\xe2\x80\x99re on a tenure track. And I love Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d'
