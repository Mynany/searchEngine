b'Brian Ziebart, assistant professor of computer science, has received a $500,000 National Science Foundation CAREER award, the NSF\xe2\x80\x99s top award for young researchers, to develop better structured prediction methods that could make autonomous vehicles safer and improve other applications in health care, financial market stability and safety.'
b'Ziebart works in the field of adversarial machine learning and is using it to improve structured prediction tasks \xe2\x80\x94 tasks that require the joint prediction of many related variables, rather than independent predictions for separate variables. For example, an autonomous vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s lane-change decision may depend on its estimates for position and velocity of nearby vehicles, its assessment of road conditions and other potential obstacles, and so on.'
b'Such a vehicle, Ziebart said, is trying to generalize from limited previous experience for machine learning, similar to the way Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAlexa\xe2\x80\x9d seeks to quickly learn its users\xe2\x80\x99 intentions and preferences.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne way to do it is to make worst-case assumptions about what you don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x94 a task for which generative adversarial networks are becoming popular.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe use a lot of optimization methodology, including convex optimization,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we use game theory to construct these prediction paths to make it efficient for real-time applications.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In the case of computer vision for a self-driving vehicle, the machine learning utilizes context.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have pixels, and you want to assign which ones are car-pixels, rather than looking at each one, you look at a wider area that defines what car-pixels should be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe car-pixels will be near road-pixels, and this idea of leveraging structure happens at multiple levels.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ziebart received his undergraduate degree in computer engineering with highest honors from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He earned a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in machine learning and his doctorate in knowledge discovery and data mining from Carnegie Mellon University. He did postdoctoral research in Carnegie Mellon\xe2\x80\x99s Human-Computer Interaction Institute and Robotics Institute before joining the UIC computer science faculty in 2012.'
