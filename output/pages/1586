b'About GradSWE'
b'Graduate students have formed a major population among UIC students. Considering women\xe2\x80\x99s increasing interest in engineering, forming a SWE graduate community UIC was inevitable. UIC GradSWE can be a valuable and resourceful community for both female graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing higher degrees. It can also serve as motivation for all women to prepare for higher education and help them smoothly transition into their future careers after they complete their education. This goal will be accomplished through different events such as training sessions, networking opportunities, scholarships, national conferences, webinars, and many other activities that will be held during each semester.'
b'This community can empower women to be successful in their field of study and to blossom as a prosperous engineer in their future career. The Mentoring Program is one of the most anticipated goals of GradSWE for the upcoming semesters. It will be beneficial to both graduate and undergraduate students, as the program will be designed to facilitate leadership skills and confidence to pursue a graduate education.'
b'Another major goal of GradSWE is to invite successful women in both academia and industry to share insightful advice on education and career hunting.'
b'Amidst these activities, UIC GradSWE will have fun events like bowling, coffee hours and many other joyful gatherings.'
