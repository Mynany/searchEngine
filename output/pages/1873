b'\n\n\n\nMovement of Social Animals\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnimals spend their lives on the move, creating networks of global connectivity that shape and increasingly are being shaped by ecosystem health. From the local quest to find food, shelter and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmates, to the long-distance traverses of global migrations, movement provides a biological framework link- ing individual processes to population dynamics in organisms ranging from bacteria to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thumans. Yet, animal movement remains a black box, limiting our ability to model and predict important processes, including potential impacts of human-induced rapid environmental change, spread of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiseases, and sustaining biodiversity. Resolving these questions is computationally challenging because of the complex interplay between individual, social and environmental processes.
