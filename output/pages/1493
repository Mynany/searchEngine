b'ABET ACCREDITATION'
b'The UIC Department of Bioengineering was founded in 1965 as one of the five original departments in the College of Engineering. In 1966, the department was awarded one of the first ten Bioengineering Training Grants by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The first undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969, and the first graduate degree in 1972.'
b'The Bioengineering Undergraduate Program has been accredited by the ABET, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (and its predecessor organizations) since 1976 and was third in the nation to receive ABET accreditation (when ABET came into existence).'
b'ABET'
b'ABET, Inc., the recognized accreditor for college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology, is a federation of 28 professional and technical societies representing these fields. Among the most respected accreditation organizations in the U.S., ABET has provided leadership and quality assurance in higher education for over 75 years.'
