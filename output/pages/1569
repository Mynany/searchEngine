b'Interim Housing allows residential students to stay on campus\xc2\xa0in between academic terms. Students may request a late departure after finals, an early arrival before the start of the spring term, or a full-period stay. Although the cost of winter break housing is included in SSR contracts, SSR residents who will stay on campus for all or part of the interim period should still apply.'
b'Interim Housing for Fall-to-Spring is from 12:00 pm Saturday, December 15 through 10:00 am Saturday, January 12, 2019. The preferred interim application deadline is December 1.'
b'Following your application, keep an eye on your UIC email for confirmation as the interim application and approval is an ongoing process.\xc2\xa0If you need to cancel your interim application, please send an email to housing@uic.edu before the start of the interim period.'
