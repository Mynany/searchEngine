b'Welcome to the UIC Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership and Resource Center'
b'The Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership and Resource Center serves as a resource for the entire campus community while placing the experiences of diverse women at its center. We work to promote gender equity through programming that raises awareness of women\xe2\x80\x99s and gender issues, develops women\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, and celebrates women\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments and contributions. We provide resources as well as individual consultation on issues such as sexual harassment and sexual assault. The WLRC provides a welcoming, safe and inclusive space for all genders that encourages dialogue and diversity. Come study, relax and chat with us.'
