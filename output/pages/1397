b'UIC\xe2\x80\x99s Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) hosted \xe2\x80\x9cNoche de Ciencias\xe2\x80\x9d (Night of Science) on Saturday, Nov. 3rd at Instituto del Progreso Latino to showcase the talent of young students in STEM field. Noche de Ciencias is a national event that occurs to increase interest and promote science, technology, engineering, and math. In Chicago, the event included hands-on activities that showed students in 6th through 12th grades the creativity of engineering while supplying them with information on STEM education and careers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur mission is to support our members to successfully achieve in their careers and empower our community to strive for similar success. Noche de Ciencias is an opportunity for SHPE to inspire families to get involved in STEM and help to answer important questions about college,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy Cueto, a student in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is crucial that we advocate to our community because we do not always receive the same opportunities or information. As students who are fortunate to be studying STEM in a university, we are determined to mentor and inspire younger students.\xe2\x80\x9d'
