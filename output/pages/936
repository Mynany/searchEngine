b'Amnesty'
b'The University recognizes that sometimes students are reluctant to seek help after experiencing sexual misconduct, or may be reluctant to help others who may have experienced sexual misconduct, because they fear being held responsible by the University or law enforcement for underage alcohol consumption or drug use. To encourage reporting, the university will not pursue disciplinary actions for alcohol/drug violations against a student making a good faith report of sexual misconduct.'
