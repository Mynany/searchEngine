b'For the second year, the department hosted Summer Teaching Institute for High School Science under the aegis of the Project Lead The Way \xe2\x80\x93 Illinois program (http://www.pltw.uillinois.edu) from July 20, 2008 through August 1, 2008. Teachers from high school within Illinois and as far away as California are attending this program. The two basic courses of the eight courses developed for the program, Principles of Engineering and Introduction to Engineering Design are offered. Professors Robert Becker and Vladimir Goncharroff served as affiliate instructors, respectively. While the teachers were on campus, they were introduced to some of the exciting research activities that are being carried out and they had an opportunity to learn about the educational programs at UIC for their students.'

b'The Project Lead The Way program is a nationally organized program designed to provide high school students with hands-on experience in engineering and to help prepare diverse student body to enter STEM disciplines in college and be successful.'
