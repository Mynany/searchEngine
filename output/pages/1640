b'Registration & Policies'
b'Zero Hour Registration'
b"Zero Hours registration is for students who have completed all degree requirements except for the master's project, master's thesis, professional doctorate project, or doctoral dissertation, and need to satisfy a registration requirement until the term of defense or graduation.\xc2\xa0 Students register for their master's project (usually 597), master's thesis (598), professional doctoral project, or doctoral dissertation (599) for 0 hours via Student-Self Service.\xc2\xa0 (Other courses that many departments offer for zero hours, such as research seminars, are not part of the descripion on this page.)\xc2\xa0 There are two options of zero hour registration, Option A and Option B.\xc2\xa0 Option A is for master's and doctoral students; Option B is only for doctoral students."
b'Students are not eligible for zero hours if you have a fellowship that requires a certain minimum hours registration (eg. University Fellowship) or a Tuition and Service-Fee Waiver from the Graduate College.\xc2\xa0 Normally, students holding an assistantship also are not eligible for zero hours although if the student who holds an assistantship does register for zero hours they will lose the tuition waiver resulting from the assistantship.'
b"Note for Student Visa Holders:\xc2\xa0 Current SEVIS (federal immigration) regulations do not allow an international student on a student visa to register for more than zero (0) hours in a subsequent term if the student was\xc2\xa0registered for zero (0) hours previously, unless the student is admitted into a different program.\xc2\xa0 This\xc2\xa0 precludes accepting an assistantship or tuition waiver for future terms after a zero-hour registration occurs.\xc2\xa0 The rationale for the regulation is that zero-hour registration is allowed for students on a visa only if all requirements other than the thesis or master's project are completed, and registration for more than zero hours indicates that they did not originally qualify, and, are thus\xc2\xa0be out of status.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, flexibility to take a course for intellectual development or to register for hours to qualify for an assistantship or tuition waiver after zero hour registration\xc2\xa0does not exist currently.\xc2\xa0 Consult with the Office of International Services (OIS) if there is a question on this issue.\n\xc2\xa0"
b"Permission to use either Option A or B will be considered by the Graduate College upon receipt of a Graduate College Student Petition supported by the graduate program.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Approval by the Director of Graduate Studies and the Graduate College signifies that all requirements except the final project, thesis, or dissertation have been completed. On rare occaisions, a course with a grade of I, DFR, or NR may still be pending, but the DGS should note the exception on the petition. Additionally, if the student goes over the degree\xc2\xa0or preliminary exam time limit after approval of zero hours, a re-evaluation of the student's status may occur.\xc2\xa0(Students must complete project\xc2\xa0or defend the thesis/dissertation by the degree deadline, regardless of which option is chosen.)"
b'Students requesting Option A\xc2\xa0only have to petition one time for zero hour approval.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doctoral students who\xc2\xa0request Option B must specify Option B on the petition and the terms requested (maximum two terms per petition).\xc2\xa0 If more than two terms of Option B are required a new petition must be filed before the start the that term. Students must re-file a petition for Option B by the 10th day of the term (5th for summer) so that the student bill is correctly calculated.'
b"Students should register via Student Self-Service for project (usually 597), master's thesis (598), professional doctorate project, or doctoral\xc2\xa0dissertation (599) by the\xc2\xa0registration deadline each term, even if the\xc2\xa0petition is still pending approval.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0"
b'The following are some scenerios where a student may need to register for zero hours:'
b"Master's Students"
b"The Graduate College does not have a registration requirement for master's students who have finished all coursework but\xc2\xa0are still completing a project or thesis.\xc2\xa0 If the student is required to be registered for another reason (see above) the student may petition to register for zero hours in the project (usually 597) or thesis (598)\xc2\xa0course.\xc2\xa0 Master's students who are in a coursework-only option are not eligible for zero hours.\xc2\xa0 Master's student's are only eligible for Zero Hours Option A.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Charges for Option A include Range IV (0 hours) tuition, tuition differential (if applicable to your program), and all related fees, including CampusCare (unless under the the opt-out option - see www.uic.edu/hsc/campuscare\xc2\xa0for information and deadlines)."

b'Doctoral\xc2\xa0Students'
b'Doctoral candidates must be registered for credit the term when they take the preliminary exam, however,\xc2\xa0doctoral students are not eligible for Zero Hours registration in the term taking the preliminary exam. Students must also register each semester (excluding summer) after passing the preliminary examination and until successfully defending the dissertation. Students must register for the summer term if\xc2\xa0taking the preliminary exam or defending the dissertation during that term.\xc2\xa0'
b'Students who hold a fellowship, assistantship, or tuition and fee waiver must register each semester for the number of hours required by their award, even if they have completed all degree requirements except the dissertation. (See Course Loads, Financial Awards section).'

b'Doctoral students who have completed all degree requirements except the dissertation, and who do not wish to register for additional coursework, must choose either:'

b'\tStudents may elect from one to two terms of Option B\xc2\xa0with each petition, and must file a new petition if future terms of Option B are required.\xc2\xa0 Note: A student is not eligible for Option B (i.e. not paying the attached fees) if registered in one or more hours.'
