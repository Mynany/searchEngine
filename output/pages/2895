b'The MBT program is a comprehensive and immersing program, allowing me to follow an individualized path into the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry. The faculty was very supportive in my career goals, and routinely assessed my options throughout the entirety of the program.'
b'Before attending the Masters in Medical Biotechnology Program, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that the MBT program is such a great platform for students who want to improve their education background for their future.'
b'After the comprehensive course study in the classroom and the practical training in the cutting-edge laboratory by the dedicated mentors, I figured out what the life of doing science is. This helped me to determine to pursue a Ph.D degree as the next step, and the strong lab experience that the MBT program provided helped me to get the offer!'
b'The connection between the MBT program and companies also helps students be in touch with industry, which greatly helps students with their job-hunting after graduation.'
b'UIC Biomedical professionals continue to provide a plethora of teaching and implementation strategies to address common concerns in the field of medicine and environment.\xc2\xa0 I had the opportunity to learn from specialists in many scientific disciplines.\xc2\xa0 Experts in the field of search databases, bioinformatics, modeling, imaging and statistics simplified my research in terms of prediction, understanding, and improved outcomes.\xc2\xa0 As my thesis was in learning and memory, I was guided through structures, substructures, nutrition, biochemicals, and ligand/receptors involved in chemical identification, energy systems and brain health.\xc2\xa0 Oxytocin, vasopressin, transient receptors and ion channel systems were of primary research interest.\xc2\xa0 The complexity of the above systems along with processing enzymes, thyroid, hormones, and additional feedback ligands/receptors provided a rich insight into learning and memory as well as other chronic conditions.\xc2\xa0 I acknowledge the dedication and great efforts of many contributors near and far.'
