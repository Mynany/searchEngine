b'ABET ACCREDITATION'
b'The Department of Mechanical Engineering was formed in 1982 when UICC was reorganized to include the Medical School and renamed to University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC); the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering was merged with the Department of Mechanical Engineering around 1986. The Industrial Engineering program showed steady growth within the Department of Mechanical Engineering and in 2002 the Department was renamed to Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.'
b'The Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Program has been accredited by the ABET, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (and its predecessor organizations) since 1985.'
b'ABET'
b'ABET, Inc., the recognized accreditor for college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology, is a federation of 28 professional and technical societies representing these fields. Among the most respected accreditation organizations in the U.S., ABET has provided leadership and quality assurance in higher education for over 75 years.'
