b'You may have heard the word internship and thought it referred to an on-campus job.\xc2\xa0 In reality, internships can include\xc2\xa0any supervised, work-related experiences related to your major field of study and/or your career interest.\xc2\xa0 Internships can also occur in a clinical, research, or traditional work setting.\xc2\xa0 Most importantly, internships allow you to apply what you have learned in the classroom and develop career skills.'
b'There are many benefits of internships:'
b'When to Intern'
b'It is best to start looking for an internship at minimum one semester prior to your desired start date \xe2\x80\x93 see next section.\xc2\xa0 Also, take note of the internship program timing of the employer and/or industry.\xc2\xa0 Some companies require application to roles months in advance of the start date.\xc2\xa0 When in doubt, speak with the employer HR or recruitment contacts for more information.'
b'Want to learn how to maximize your internship?'
