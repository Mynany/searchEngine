b'About The Academic & Residential Complex'
b'This new integrated living-learning community located near Harrison and Morgan Streets is more than 151,000 square feet. The 10-story building will provide residential accommodations for approximately 550 students in a traditional and semi-suite style environment. Within the residential footprint, approximately 16,000 square feet will feature a fitness center,  a large academic lounge, laundry facilities, social & study lounges on each floor and a tenth-floor sky lounge.'
b'Attached to the residential building is the classroom building with over 50,000 square feet of academic space. This area includes three large lecture halls, four classrooms, multiple small group study rooms, a tutoring center, computer stations and several collaboration spaces. Among the classrooms, the largest 258-seat classroom can also be transformed into a flexible event and performance space. This space will also include instructional spaces with \xe2\x80\x9cturn to team\xe2\x80\x9d design elements, a learning oasis, and a C-Stop. The retail space, anticipated to be used as a cafe, will be approximately 1,600 square feet of the project.'
