b'MS and PhD Degree Requirements'
b'The Master of Science program is designed for students who have received their undergraduate degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and wish to develop greater depth and/or breadth in computer science. The MS degree prepares students for more challenging\xe2\x80\x93and often more highly-compensated\xe2\x80\x93work in their professional careers. UIC Computer Science MS alumni have traditionally been well-positioned for interesting and rewarding careers.'
b'MS degree could be completed with a Coursework, Project or Thesis Option. Full-time, well-prepared, highly motivated students may complete the program in as few as three semesters; most students complete the program in four to six semesters of residence.'
b'Detailed MS degree requirements are published below:'
b'CS Graduate Degree Requirements '
b'The Doctor of Philosophy program is designed for students who have received their MS degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and who wish to develop greater depth and breadth in computer science, with particular emphasis on the development of expertise in Computer Science research. The PhD degree prepares students for the most challenging\xe2\x80\x93and often most highly-compensated\xe2\x80\x93work in the field of Computer Science. Typically, PhD graduates are employed in commercial or industrial research, or themselves become faculty members in Computer Science departments throughout the world.'
b'Exceptional applicants who have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, or a related field, and wish to pursue a PhD will be considered for a \xe2\x80\x9cDirect PhD Admission\xe2\x80\x9d.

b'CS Graduate Student Processes'
b'Course Selection'
b'All graduate students should select classes independently in their area of interest. \xc2\xa0PhD students should consult their faculty advisor for course recommendations. A maximum of 8 hours of non-CS graduate courses may be counted toward the overall course work requirement. However, prior formal approval via petition is required. Consult CS Student Affairs office for details on submitting a petition. \xc2\xa0New students should note that courses taken and grades obtained in their first semester of enrollment largely determine financial aid awards for the following academic year.'
b'Unless specifically advised otherwise, new graduate students should not enroll in the following courses for their first semester: CS 597 Project Research; CS 598 MS Thesis Research; or CS 599 PhD Thesis Research. \xc2\xa0Students should take regularly scheduled courses during their first semester.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Registration Restrictions* \xe2\x80\x93 CS graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Anyone in violation of the registration policy can be removed from courses by the department until their credit hours of didactic classes no longer exceeds the limit for that semester. In addition, students violating this policy may also be restricted from future registration until until they have met with the DGS.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'How is it implemented?'
b'Any exemption have to be cleared by the DGS or the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905). \xc2\xa0We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs.'
b'*The department may implement new temporary restrictions as needed.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Other course processes'
b'Some 400 level courses in the MCS department overlap with CS lower level courses. Graduate credit in CS is not allowed for such courses. For example, graduate credit is not allowed for MCS 441 Theory of Computation, which is the same as CS 301 (Languages and Automata). Courses in IDS are generally not allowed to count towards graduation. \xc2\xa0If you are uncertain, please check with the CS Student Affairs Office, the DGS and/or your faculty advisor prior to registering for the course.'
b'Students who receive any form of financial aid from the University (TA, RA, Fellowship or Tuition & Fee Waiver) are subject to minimum registration requirements, which must be maintained throughout the semester. \xc2\xa0See graduate college website for requirements with assistantships: http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships. \xc2\xa0Students who have been awarded a Fellowship or TFW must be registered for a minimum of 12 hours in Fall and Spring semester; and 6 hours in Summer. \xc2\xa0Note: If you fall below the required hours at any point in the semester, you become ineligible for the tuition waiver and will be assessed all fees.'
b' http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships'
b'The department requires all students supported by a TA position to register for a minimum of 8 credit hours of coursework each semester (except Summer), until they have completed the required coursework. \xc2\xa0Upon completion of the coursework you can follow the graduate college registration requirements for the appropriate percentage appointment. These minimum hours are the requirement for a student to be considered as full-time. Students supported on fellowships or tuition and fee waivers are already required to have a minimum of 12 credit hours of registration in regular semesters and a minimum of 6 credit hours in summer. Students who need to complete prerequisites should register for additional courses to achieve a 12-hour registration. Students working on MS project, MS thesis or PhD dissertations should register for CS 597, CS 598 or CS 599 hours, respectively.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Course Prerequisites'
b'If your undergraduate degree is not from UIC, please make sure that your course background is equivalent to the recommended course prerequisites. Talk to the instructor of the course if you have any concerns about prerequisites. You are responsible for the course prerequisites, not your instructor. You will not be allowed to withdraw from a course after the drop deadline because you have not met the prerequisites. The drop deadline is 10th day of classes for Fall & Spring and 5th day for Summer terms. This drop deadline is strictly enforced for all courses.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Adding/Dropping/Withdrawing Courses'
b'Students should finalize their class schedule by the end of the add/drop period (10th day for Fall & Spring, 5th day for Summer terms). \xc2\xa0Once the add/drop period has ended, students are not allowed to add/drop classes.'
b'Any requests to add/withdraw from a class after the add/drop period must be petitioned, with support from instructor (not advisor) of the class. \xc2\xa0Submit the petition to the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905) along with all supporting documentation for the DGS to review.'
b'As a general policy, you will not be permitted to withdraw from courses (particularly the 300 and 400 level courses in CS). \xc2\xa0If permission (from the Director of Graduate Studies) is granted for such a \xe2\x80\x9clate drop\xe2\x80\x9d, it will be reported as a withdrawal (W) on the transcript. \xc2\xa0A \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be stricken from your permanent record and cannot be replaced by a new grade should you retake the course and obtain a letter grade.'
b'The following are examples of unacceptable reasons for dropping a course after the deadline: \xe2\x80\x9cI have had this material before\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cThis course will not be useful to me\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI am taking too many courses\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not have the prerequisites\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to drop the course before the drop deadline\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cA bad grade will affect my GPA negatively\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI have not attended classes for the past few weeks\xe2\x80\x9d. \xc2\xa0It is your responsibility to make sure that you enroll in classes that are appropriate for your academic course load, schedule and that you have met all prerequisites.'
b'Students holding fellowships, assistantships, tuition and fee waivers, and student visas must maintain the required number of credit hours or risk loss of their aid for the term. Students whose waivers are revoked due to insufficient credit hours will be billed the full cost of tuition, fees and any late charges that may apply.'
b'Students are allowed to register for a maximum total of 20 hours per semester. Note: students must remain compliance with the CS departments registration policy for graduate students. \xc2\xa0In order to register for more than 20 hours, the student must have approval from his/her advisor and submit that information to SEO 905 for override permission.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Good Academic Standing'
b'In addition to the Graduate college defined good standing satus (http://grad.uic.edu/continuing-student-status), Computer Science graduate students should not be in violation of any conduct policies or academic dishonesty.'
