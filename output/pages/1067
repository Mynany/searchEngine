b'Home'
b'All Engineering students are required to seek advising from their faculty advisor prior to registering for the Summer and Fall 2018 terms.\xc2\xa0 An advising hold will be placed on the record of each Engineering student which will prevent them from registering until they speak with their faculty advisor.'
b'Engineering students should visit their departmental offices to make an appointment with their advisor during the 9th week of the term (March 12 \xe2\x80\x93 16). \xc2\xa0Advising will take place during the 10th week of the term (March 19 \xe2\x80\x93 23).\xc2\xa0 Failure to see your faculty advisor during this time may result in delaying your registration.'

b'Physics Placement Test'
b'As a reminder to any student who plans to take Phys 141, there is a new placement test that was put in place last Summer. The prerequisite to take Phys 141 is a grade of \xe2\x80\x9cC or better\xe2\x80\x9d or concurrent registration in Math 180 ; AND a grade of \xe2\x80\x9cC or better\xe2\x80\x9d in Phys 100 or adequate performance on the physics placement test. The physics placement test assesses your capabilities in high school algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and word problems that require quantitative reasoning. No specific background in physics is required. Information about continuing student placement test reservations can be found at : http://testing.uic.edu/online-tests-for-continuing-students/'
b'http://testing.uic.edu/online-tests-for-continuing-students/'
b'Time Ticket (Appointment to Register)'
b'All eligible continuing students will be able to view their time ticket on\xc2\xa0my.UIC.edu\xc2\xa0.'

b'Add / Drop / Deadlines'
b'Engineering students may DROP a class through the Friday of the second week of the Fall and Spring Semesters, through the third day of Summer Session I and through the Friday of the first week of Summer Session II without any penalty.'
b'All undergraduate students have\xc2\xa0four opportunities\xc2\xa0over the course of their UIC enrollment to drop a course without penalty from the\xc2\xa0third through tenth weeks\xc2\xa0of the Fall and Spring Semesters and from the\xc2\xa0second through fifth weeksof the Summer Session II (late drops for Summer Session I are allowed through\xc2\xa0Wednesday of week three).'
b'Late drops in this period are approved, regardless of the circumstances, provided that the student submits a Late Drop Petition Form to the COE Front Office (123 SEO) within the designated period and that the student has not exceeded the limit of four late drops. The merits of the student\xe2\x80\x99s request are not a factor in determining eligibility for an exception.\xc2\xa0'
b'Requests to drop a course after the deadlines listed above or requests to drop a course within the approved exception period in excess of the four automatic drops are not routinely granted unless there are exceptional circumstances, outside of the student\xe2\x80\x99s control and that can be documented. Requests require a written petition and are reviewed by the Dean of the College. Poor performance in a course is not a sufficient reason to justify approval of a request.\xc2\xa0'
b'Because of the limitations on dropping classes, students are advised to evaluate their academic standing in the course with the instructor before requesting to exercise one of the allowable late drops.'
b'Repeating a course with Grade Point Average Recalculation'
b'***This policy is only available to students admitted to UIC prior to Fall 2017***\xc2\xa0 All students admitted Fall 2017 and after are bound by a new\xc2\xa0Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses.\xc2\xa0 For classes taken at UIC from the Fall 2009 forward, you can petition to have Grade Point Average Recalculation for up to 4 courses total during your UIC studies.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0YOU MUST DECLARE YOUR INTENT TO DO SO BY THE END OF THE 2ND WEEK OF CLASSES (1ST WEEK DURING SUMMER).\xc2\xa0 Petition forms may be obtained from the main Engineering office in room 123 SEO.\xc2\xa0 More information on this policy can be found in the online UIC catalog under the heading\xc2\xa0Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation.'
b'Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses'
b'Repeating a Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation.'
b'Taking a course Credit/No Credit'
b'Certain types of courses may be taken on the credit/no credit option in the College of Engineering. In this option, a student will be allowed to complete a limited number of courses with a grade of credit (CR) or no credit (NC) instead of a letter grade. Courses below the 200-level, required courses, and essential prerequisite courses cannot be taken as credit/no credit. For detailed information on the college\xe2\x80\x99s policy on credit/no credit, the student should inquire in 123 SEO. Students should also check with the Department of the course they want to take Credit/No Credit to make sure that it is eligible.\xc2\xa0 Certain courses in Departments are not allowed to be taken Credit / No Credit.\xc2\xa0 Students should verify with the offering Department before submitting the form in Room 123 SEO.  Check your record for any holds that may prevent you from registering. \xc2\xa0 Students may login to\xc2\xa0my.UIC.edu\xc2\xa0to find out if there are any holds on their account that will prevent registration.\xc2\xa0 ALL Engineering students will have an Advising Hold placed on their record until they speak with their advisor.'

b'Student Responsibility'
b'As a student, you are responsible for knowing and adhering to the policies, deadline, and procedures contained in the Timetable.\xc2\xa0 Avoid potential enrollment problems by carefully reading University rules and regulations regarding registration and add/drop of courses.\xc2\xa0 You can receive credit only for those courses for which you are properly registered.\xc2\xa0 Likewise, you assume academic and financial responsibility for any course for which you register unless you officially cancel or withdraw your registration according to established deadline, which are published at the University.'
b'As a precaution, you should verify your schedule prior to the 1st day of classes, before the add/drop deadline (end of 2nd week), and prior to the late drop deadline (end of 10th week).\xc2\xa0'
