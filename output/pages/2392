b'Professor Milos Zefran has received the National Science Foundation CAREER AWARD for developing a systematic framework for design of a new generation of personal robotic systems that are reliable, safe and suitable for mass production. This research could bridge the gap between the research on high-level reasoning which guarantees autonomy and low level control that ensures safety and high mechanical performance. This type of personal robot could revolutionize everyday life in a similar way that computers have during the last decade.'
