b' Professor Michael Stroscio Wins Excellence in Teaching Award'
b'Home'
b'2016'
b' '
b'Every year, UIC honors a select few of its most dedicated and outstanding faculty members with the Award for Excellence in Teaching. This year, Distinguished Professor Mike Stroscio, of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), has been selected by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost as a recipient of the prestigious award.'
b'He was selected by past recipients of the award from nominations made by departments and colleges. He earned the award based on his accomplishments and goals in teaching, which emphasize his philosophy of teaching as well as any formal contributions to teaching effectiveness.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy basic approach as a teacher is to make sure my students are given the information on the basic first principles of the subject and to provide them with the essential tools to participate in technological developments,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stroscio. \xe2\x80\x9cI also provide opportunities to train them to be independent, critical thinkers to empower them in their future careers.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'His methods are motivated by these teaching goals, which he strives to attain in all his undergraduate and graduate classes. His methods for achieving these goals differ depending on the level of the course and on the academic maturity of the student in the case of research-based teaching.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the research setting, I meet with undergraduate research students and graduate research students,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stroscio. \xe2\x80\x9cThese joint meetings have been particularly effective because the group interactions between students allow them to exchange ideas and to build on these ideas to become effective independent researchers.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'According to Stroscio, the research-based teaching experiences have significant benefits by collaborating with other teachers who have also worked with his students. The collaborative efforts bring many ideas to the table and offer students a variety of research paths.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn many cases, their choice of research topic has a direct influence in placement after graduation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stroscio. \xe2\x80\x9cThe students have been placed in industry, government and academia.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a major teaching recognition for one of ECE\xe2\x80\x99s most dedicated and outstanding teachers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Rashid Ansari, ECE department head, who wrote a letter of endorsement for Stroscio.'
b'Stroscio, who is about to celebrate is 15 year of teaching at UIC, will receive a $5,000 increase in his base salary and will be honored at the Faculty Awards Celebration on October 26, 2016.'
