b"Computer Science is an extremely rich and diverse discipline.  At one end of the spectrum, computer science may be viewed as the formal study of what can be computed and what resources are required for computation.  At the other end of the spectrum, computer science may be seen as the application of human resources, software and of course, computers to solve computational problems relating to society's and individuals' needs."
b'A well-trained computer scientist requires a knowledge of both ends of this spectrum--and several points in between.  The Computer Science curriculum in the Department of Computer Science is intended to provide that broad background.  Along with a strong theoretical component, our program places special emphasis on the development of applied skills in design, implementation and validation of computer systems.  In our experience, industry and graduate programs alike value--above all--people who can solve real problems, and who come prepared to use the tools of their trade.'
b'All students acquire a common background in the fundamental areas of computer science: computer systems, organization and architecture, algorithms and data structures, principles of software design, elements of the theory of computation, and operating systems.  In addition, students obtain specialized backgrounds through the selection of five technical elective courses in Computer Science.  Required and elective courses in the sciences and mathematics, along with additional courses in writing, humanities, social sciences and the arts give students the opportunity to expand their horizons and to prepare for multi disciplinary careers.'
b'There are very few areas in modern society untouched by Computer Science.  Computer science is present in everything from health care, telecommunications and entertainment, to transportation, education and defense. The result of this diversity is that a computer scientist must be capable of working with people outside his or her field.  In support of this, the Computer Science program provides its students with a well-rounded education requiring significant course work outside the Department of Computer Science, placing a strong emphasis on writing and communication skills.'

b'Concentration Areas'
b'The Computer Systems Concentration represents a sub-specialty that provides more emphasis on understanding and designing computer hardware.  The student continues to learn the fundamental areas of computer science: programming, data structures, discrete math, algorithms, formal languages, architecture and operating systems.  Unlike traditional computer science, however, the student also studies low-level circuit analysis and high-level system design, and has the option to take additional hardware-oriented courses.  The result is a unique blend of computer science and computer engineering.'
b'The Software Engineering Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in software engineering.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science, including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems.  In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of software engineering practice such as software cost estimation, large-scale software development, and risk management.'
b'The Human-Centered Computing Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in areas such as: user-interface design and development for desktop or mobile devices; computer graphics and animation for video games, movie special effects; and scientific-, engineering- and medical visualization.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems. In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of human-centered computing practice such as user-interface design, computer graphics, visual media, and natural language processing.'

b'Undergraduate Advising'
b"All College of Engineering undergraduate students are required to be advised before they are able to register for classes each semester, 'advising hold' will not be removed until you are advised.  In Fall and Spring you will receive email from the department or your advisor about advising sign-up and advising appointments.  You should complete this before registration becomes available in the 11th week."
b'Find your advisor from the advising list.  If you do not hear from you advisor by the 9th week, get in touch with them for an appointment.'
b'advising list'
b'You must bring your DARS report, list of courses you are interested in taking for the next semester and any questions you have for your appointment. Once you are advised, fill out the advising form with your advisor and submit it to the CS Student Affairs office (SEO 905).  Keep your white copy for your records.  Staff in the office will remove your advising hold within 2-3 business days.'
b' Questions regarding advising can be directed to the CS Student Affairs Office, SEO 905.'
