b'Welcome message from Bob Sloan, Department Head'
b'OUR PROGRAMS'
b'The Computer Science Department offers three degrees: the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (including concentrations in Computer Systems and Software Engineering), the Master of Science in Computer Science, and the Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science. Our academic programs are designed to prepare students for successful careers in a rapidly evolving discipline, and we place a strong emphasis on design principles and practice.'

b'Computer Science remains an outstanding major for these difficult times. Our graduates continue to find excellent jobs, and equally important, Computer Science empowers you to do good: to connect technology to your world.'
b'OUR HISTORY'
b'We are a department both old and new. The University of Illinois at Chicago was founded in 1965, and as Computer Science grew as a field, Computer Science faculty were housed in the Department of Information Engineering, which in 1982 became the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In July 2001, Computer Science became a department in its own right.'
