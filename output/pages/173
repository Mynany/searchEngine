b'http://grad.uic.edu/registration-policies'
b'Doctoral students upon passing the preliminary exam are required to register for at least zero credit hours each semester (excluding summer) until the final defense is completed and the dissertation is submitted in compliance with department and Graduate College rules. \xc2\xa0If the PhD candidate decides to defend during the Summer, registration is required for Summer term.\xc2\xa0 PhD candidates are not required to register after they successfully defend their dissertation unless registration is required to maintain a specific status (i.e., assistantship, visa, or continued use of university facilities).'
b'If a PhD candidate successfully defends the dissertation and submits the final dissertation to the Graduate College after the semester deadline but prior to the fifth day of instruction of the following semester, the degree is conferred in the subsequent semester. Registration for that semester is not required.'
b'See http://grad.uic.edu/zero-hour-registration for further details.'
b' http://grad.uic.edu/zero-hour-registration'
b'Time Restrictions'
b'Students admitted to the Graduate College with a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree or who continue in the Graduate College after completing the master\xe2\x80\x99s degree at UIC must complete the degree requirements within seven consecutive calendar years after initial registration as a doctoral student. Students admitted to the Graduate College without a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree who proceed directly to the doctorate must complete degree requirements within nine consecutive calendar years of initial registration as a doctoral student. Students who do not graduate by these deadlines will be dismissed from the Graduate College for failure to progress. Time spent on a leave of absence approved by the program and the Graduate College is not counted toward the degree time limit.'
b'Transfer Credit'
b'After admission to the PhD program, students may petition to transfer coursework not used for previous degree. \xc2\xa0A maximum of 9 semester hours earned outside the department are eligible for transfer; credits from non US institutions are generally not allowed. A transcript showing the courses with grades and course syllabi must be submitted with the Transfer Credit petition. Upon request, the student must also provide an official letter from the university stating the course(s) were not used to satisfy any prior degree requirements. Students changing from \xe2\x80\x9cnon-degree\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdegree\xe2\x80\x9d status at UIC may petition up to 12 semester hours of credit earned. Only graduate level courses in which a grade of A or B was earned will be eligible for transfer. Transfer credit from outside UIC is not allowed once a student starts their graduate studies in the Computer Science program at UIC.'
b'Changing to the MS Program: Not allowed'
b'The UIC College of Engineering Strategic Plan, adopted in January 2005 and revised from time to time, states that students in a PhD program who have received any financial support from UIC (such as TA, RA, or Tuition and Fee Waiver) cannot transfer into any MS program in the College of Engineering (which includes computer science) \xe2\x80\x9cunless the student explicitly petitions to transfer to the MS program and that petition is approved\xe2\x80\x9d.'
b'PhD candidates admitted directly from the BS degree, do NOT earn a MS degree prior to their PhD.\xc2\xa0 They graduate only with a PhD degree.'
b'Prior Publication of Research Findings'
b'Students engaged in research may choose to publish certain findings that are later incorporated into the final dissertation. \xc2\xa0In such cases, appropriate acknowledgment of the earlier publication should be included in the final dissertation.\xc2\xa0 The Graduate College encourages such publication, but the dissertation may not be published in its entirety before all degree requirements, including the defense of the dissertation, have been completed.'
b'The current Qualifying Exam has been in effect since Fall 2012.'
b'PhD Qualifying Exam Information\xc2\xa0provides details on the requirements of it\xe2\x80\x99s successful completion of each of the three parts.'
b'PhD Qualifying Exam Information'
b'The purpose of the Preliminary Examination is to determine the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to undertake dissertation research, and passing it constitutes formal Admission to Candidacy. The examination serves as the next major step toward the PhD degree except for the completion and defense of the dissertation. The examination provides the student with timely feedback of the faculty\xe2\x80\x99s views of his/her potential for completing the PhD Program.'
b'The preliminary examination is generally administered once the student has completed most, though not necessarily all, of the coursework, but has not made a major investment of time and effort towards the dissertation research project. A minimum of one year has to elapse before the defense of the dissertation after passing the preliminary examination. Only students in good academic standing are permitted to take the examination.'
b'Preliminary Examination Committee'
b'The committee for the preliminary examination is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College upon the recommendation of the department or program. \xc2\xa0The advisor is the chair of the Committee and must be a full member of the UIC Graduate Faculty.\xc2\xa0 All CS assistant, associate, full professors and adjunct faculty are eligible to serve as an advisor. \xc2\xa0The composition of the five-member committee should be as follows:'
b'Graduate programs strive for diversity in the composition of the preliminary examination committee. \xc2\xa0The appointment of one or two members from outside the degree-granting program or university is encouraged. \xc2\xa0If the outside member is not a UIC graduate faculty member, his/her curriculum vitae must accompany the Committee Recommendation Form to demonstrate equivalent academic standards.'
b'Preliminary Examination Pass Requirements'
b'A Committee Recommendation form (http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-student-forms), listing the committee members and their affiliations, must be submitted at least three weeks prior to the exam date to the CS Student Affairs for department approval. \xc2\xa0Upon department approval, the form will be forwarded to the Graduate College for final approval.\xc2\xa0 If human subjects are involved, Institutional Review Board approval is required. \xc2\xa0If animals are involved, Animal Care Panel approval is required. \xc2\xa0Graduate College will forward an examination report to the department, which has to be signed by each member of the committee after assigning a grade of \xe2\x80\x9cpass\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfail\xe2\x80\x9d. \xc2\xa0The timing, content, and nature (written, oral, or both) of the preliminary examination is left at the discretion of the preliminary examination committee.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A candidate cannot be passed with more than one \xe2\x80\x9cfail\xe2\x80\x9d vote.'
b'http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-student-forms'
b'The committee may require that specified conditions be met before the passing recommendation becomes effective. \xc2\xa0On the recommendation of the committee, the Dean may permit a second examination.\xc2\xa0 A third examination is not permitted. \xc2\xa0Failure to complete the degree requirements within five years (departments may specify shorter periods) of passing the preliminary examination requires a new examination.'
b'The Graduate College requires the preliminary examination be completed after at least one calendar year of residence and one year prior to the final dissertation defense.'
b'Upon completion of all degree requirements and dissertation, the candidate must orally defend the work before the committee. \xc2\xa0Only students in good academic standing are permitted to defend their dissertation.\xc2\xa0 A new Committee Recommendation form must be filed, listing the dissertation title and committee members. \xc2\xa0The chairperson (advisor) is considered the primary reader of the dissertation.\xc2\xa0 A second and/or third member of the committee may also be designated as \xe2\x80\x9creaders.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The dissertation committee is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College on the recommendation of the student\xe2\x80\x99s department. \xc2\xa0The Committee Recommendation form is available online through the Graduate College website (http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-student-forms), which must be filled and submitted to the CS Student Affairs office at least three weeks prior to the exam date. \xc2\xa0The committee composition requirements of the final defense committee are the same as the preliminary committee, except the appointment of one member from outside the degree-granting program is mandatory. \xc2\xa0The committee composition of the committee is as follows:'
b'http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-student-forms'
b'Federal regulations require that any research which involves the use of either human subjects or animals be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the Animal Care Committee (ACC). The regulations are all-inclusive in that surveys, interviews, pre-existing data and human tissues obtained for non-research purposes require review by the IRB before the research can be done. If the work is completed without IRB or ACC approval, it cannot be published, even as a thesis. Copies of the IRB or ACC approval must be included in the appendix of the final draft of the thesis submitted for review by the Graduate College. It is University policy that theses which are not in compliance with the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects (OPRS) will not be accepted for fulfillment of graduation requirements. For further information, see http://grad.uic.edu/office-protection-research-subjects / or contact OPRS.'
b'Format Guidelines'

b'CS Graduate Student Processes'
b'CS Graduate Student Processes'
b'Course Selection'
b'All graduate students should select classes independently in their area of interest. \xc2\xa0PhD students should consult their faculty advisor for course recommendations. A maximum of 8 hours of non-CS graduate courses may be counted toward the overall course work requirement. However, prior formal approval via petition is required. Consult CS Student Affairs office for details on submitting a petition. \xc2\xa0New students should note that courses taken and grades obtained in their first semester of enrollment largely determine financial aid awards for the following academic year.'
b'Unless specifically advised otherwise, new graduate students should not enroll in the following courses for their first semester: CS 597 Project Research; CS 598 MS Thesis Research; or CS 599 PhD Thesis Research. \xc2\xa0Students should take regularly scheduled courses during their first semester.'
b'Registration Restrictions* \xe2\x80\x93 CS graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Anyone in violation of the registration policy can be removed from courses by the department until their credit hours of didactic classes no longer exceeds the limit for that semester. In addition, students violating this policy may also be restricted from future registration until until they have met with the DGS.'
b'How is it implemented?'
b'Any exemption have to be cleared by the DGS or the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905). \xc2\xa0We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs.'
b'*The department may implement new temporary restrictions as needed.'
b'Other course processes'
b'Some 400 level courses in the MCS department overlap with CS lower level courses. Graduate credit in CS is not allowed for such courses. For example, graduate credit is not allowed for MCS 441 Theory of Computation, which is the same as CS 301 (Languages and Automata). Courses in IDS are generally not allowed to count towards graduation. \xc2\xa0If you are uncertain, please check with the CS Student Affairs Office, the DGS and/or your faculty advisor prior to registering for the course.'
b'Students who receive any form of financial aid from the University (TA, RA, Fellowship or Tuition & Fee Waiver) are subject to minimum registration requirements, which must be maintained throughout the semester. \xc2\xa0See graduate college website for requirements with assistantships: http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships. \xc2\xa0Students who have been awarded a Fellowship or TFW must be registered for a minimum of 12 hours in Fall and Spring semester; and 6 hours in Summer. \xc2\xa0Note: If you fall below the required hours at any point in the semester, you become ineligible for the tuition waiver and will be assessed all fees.'
b' http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships'
b'The department requires all students supported by a TA position to register for a minimum of 8 credit hours of coursework each semester (except Summer), until they have completed the required coursework. \xc2\xa0Upon completion of the coursework you can follow the graduate college registration requirements for the appropriate percentage appointment. These minimum hours are the requirement for a student to be considered as full-time. Students supported on fellowships or tuition and fee waivers are already required to have a minimum of 12 credit hours of registration in regular semesters and a minimum of 6 credit hours in summer. Students who need to complete prerequisites should register for additional courses to achieve a 12-hour registration. Students working on MS project, MS thesis or PhD dissertations should register for CS 597, CS 598 or CS 599 hours, respectively.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Course Prerequisites'
b'If your undergraduate degree is not from UIC, please make sure that your course background is equivalent to the recommended course prerequisites. Talk to the instructor of the course if you have any concerns about prerequisites. You are responsible for the course prerequisites, not your instructor. You will not be allowed to withdraw from a course after the drop deadline because you have not met the prerequisites. The drop deadline is 10th day of classes for Fall & Spring and 5th day for Summer terms. This drop deadline is strictly enforced for all courses.'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'Adding/Dropping/Withdrawing Courses'
b'Students should finalize their class schedule by the end of the add/drop period (10th day for Fall & Spring, 5th day for Summer terms). \xc2\xa0Once the add/drop period has ended, students are not allowed to add/drop classes.'
b'Any requests to add/withdraw from a class after the add/drop period must be petitioned, with support from instructor (not advisor) of the class. \xc2\xa0Submit the petition to the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905) along with all supporting documentation for the DGS to review.'
b'As a general policy, you will not be permitted to withdraw from courses (particularly the 300 and 400 level courses in CS). \xc2\xa0If permission (from the Director of Graduate Studies) is granted for such a \xe2\x80\x9clate drop\xe2\x80\x9d, it will be reported as a withdrawal (W) on the transcript. \xc2\xa0A \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be stricken from your permanent record and cannot be replaced by a new grade should you retake the course and obtain a letter grade.'
b'The following are examples of unacceptable reasons for dropping a course after the deadline: \xe2\x80\x9cI have had this material before\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cThis course will not be useful to me\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI am taking too many courses\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not have the prerequisites\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to drop the course before the drop deadline\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cA bad grade will affect my GPA negatively\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI have not attended classes for the past few weeks\xe2\x80\x9d. \xc2\xa0It is your responsibility to make sure that you enroll in classes that are appropriate for your academic course load, schedule and that you have met all prerequisites.'
b'Students holding fellowships, assistantships, tuition and fee waivers, and student visas must maintain the required number of credit hours or risk loss of their aid for the term. Students whose waivers are revoked due to insufficient credit hours will be billed the full cost of tuition, fees and any late charges that may apply.'
b'Students are allowed to register for a maximum total of 20 hours per semester. Note: students must remain compliance with the CS departments registration policy for graduate students. \xc2\xa0In order to register for more than 20 hours, the student must have approval from his/her advisor and submit that information to SEO 905 for override permission.'
b'Good Academic Standing'
b'In addition to the Graduate college defined good standing satus (http://grad.uic.edu/continuing-student-status), Computer Science graduate students should not be in violation of any conduct policies or academic dishonesty.'
b'http://grad.uic.edu/continuing-student-status'
b'Grades'
b'Coursework earn grades of A, B, C, D or F; research hours a \xe2\x80\x98S\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98U\xe2\x80\x99. \xc2\xa0GPA is calculated based on the grades and credits hours.\xc2\xa0 For details see: http://grad.uic.edu/grades.'
b' http://grad.uic.edu/grades'
b'Probation and Academic Dismissal'
b'All graduate students are required to maintain a 3.0 (B) grade point average (GPA). \xc2\xa0The GPA calculation does not include independent study and research courses (CS 590, CS 595-599).'
b'Graduate course work must be satisfied by a C grade or higher. \xc2\xa0If a student\xe2\x80\x99s graduate GPA falls below 3.0 (B), the Graduate College will issue a letter of warning and impose academic probation for a specified period of time. \xc2\xa0Failure to comply with the terms will likely result in dismissal from the CS program and Graduate College.\xc2\xa0 Details of this available at: http://grad.uic.edu/probation-and-academic-dismissal.'
