b"Isadore and Sadie Dorin immigrated to the West side of Chicago from Russia as teenagers in the early 1900's. They met, married and built a successful business near what is now UIC. The Dorin Family Foundation, created by family members to honor their legacy, donated $3 million to UIC. The gift will establish a term naming of the UIC Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum, which stands on a stretch of Roosevelt Road the young family often traveled. In addition, the gift will provide scholarships to undergraduate students with high academic achievement who graduated from a Cook County high school."
b'To honor this generous gift from the Dorin Family Foundation, we held a ribbon cutting ceremony to formally announce the term naming of the UIC Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum and celebrate the legacy of the Dorin family.'
