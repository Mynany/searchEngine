b'Daniel Gray refused to let a difficult first semester at UIC defer his dream of graduating from college.'
b'He faced a tough calculus course \xe2\x80\x94 one that his high school math coursework did not prepare him well for \xe2\x80\x94 and financial stress.'
b'But it was his tenacity that got him through the challenges and to his December graduation \xe2\x80\x94 with a job at Boeing waiting for him in Seattle starting in January.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of other people who are naturally smarter, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just take smarts \xe2\x80\x94 it takes determination and a lot of hunger to make it through,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gray, a senior in mechanical engineering. \xe2\x80\x9cI just run my head into the wall, and eventually, I break through. You just have to keep going.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He faced financial challenges during his first semester and could not find a steady job, so he took on odd jobs walking dogs and baby-sitting to earn some extra money while tackling his challenging coursework.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a new adjustment to learn material that\xe2\x80\x99s complicated and intricate and take an exam in the time given. I just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI told myself that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to give up or be defeated by a class. Overcoming that challenge was satisfying.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He found help for his academic struggles through the UIC Minority Engineering Recruitment and Retention Program. His academics improved through regular tutoring there.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI found my home base on campus there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'All of his time spent at the program offices didn\xe2\x80\x99t go unnoticed \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, program leaders offered him a job, which helped him overcome his financial stress.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be grateful enough for that program,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Gray found other opportunities through his involvement with the National Society of Black Engineers. Through networking and job fairs at the society\xe2\x80\x99s conferences, Gray was hired for internships at Toyota and Ford.'
b'Those internships aligned with his passion for cars \xe2\x80\x94 an interest that led him to his mechanical engineering major.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a strong interest and curiosity with cars, and that started with playing Hot Wheels and Legos with my little brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a strong interest of mine for as long as I can remember.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At Toyota, he was part of a product development team that designed a method to measure shell bodies between spraying processes. The internship was helpful, he said, but he found a better fit at Ford, where he created an apparatus that measured wheel travel relative to the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s body, among other projects.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI took what I learned at Toyota and I became a lot hungrier for work, so I would be a lot more direct asking for help or more projects,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an amazing experience. I learned a lot about myself and helped broaden my horizon about what I want to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He connected with his future employer, Boeing, through the National Society of Black Engineers, too. Starting in January, he will be a structural design engineer, working on the wing team for the company\xe2\x80\x99s latest commercial airplane.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be working for a company like Boeing and moving across the country really is still such a shock \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m excited and nervous. So many feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
