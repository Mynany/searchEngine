b'Four years ago, Sol Savchuk reset her life.'
b'Moving to the U.S. from Ukraine, Savchuk fled her war-torn homeland alone to seek asylum.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t safe for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Savchuk said, recalling the violence that led to the 2014 Ukraine Revolution. She helped some of the injured as a medical volunteer.'
b'But coming to a foreign country forced her to face other fights \xe2\x80\x94 ones that threatened her goal of becoming a doctor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs an asylum-seeker, I was not eligible for any federal aid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Savchuk, who longed to resume her undergraduate studies in the U.S.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSince I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any family here, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone co-sign a loan for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, there were two years where I really just worked and tried to put together some financial basis for college.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In those years, she was promoted in the restaurant where she worked, making her way from barista to service manager. Still, she recalls being discouraged from pursuing her dreams.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI remember someone told me that I would never get a medical degree being a first-generation immigrant,\xe2\x80\x9d Savchuk said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey told me it was impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And not knowing whether she\xe2\x80\x99d overcome those adversities sometimes took its toll.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose two years of being out of school and not being sure if I\xe2\x80\x99d ever get back on my feet were the most difficult ones,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Savchuk did get back on her feet.'
b'In 2016, she enrolled as an Honors College student at UIC while working almost full time.'
b'As a student, she majored in neuroscience and assumed leadership roles in organizations like TEDxUIC and the Society for Future Physicians.'
b'She also worked in research labs. One at UIC explored psychology-related topics of cognition and language. Another at Northwestern University focused on brain cancer and glioblastoma.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe work on different techniques, including immunotherapy, stem cell therapy and nanotechnologies,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ultimately translate our knowledge to patient care.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Her leadership and merits have even helped her win awards and scholarships, including Honors College tuition waivers and the Mark A. Wyatt Memorial Scholarship, which goes to outstanding pre-med students in the sciences.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am so grateful for all of the support,\xe2\x80\x9d said Savchuk, adding that she\xe2\x80\x99s learned to stay motivated and determined.'
b'As Savchuk waits to graduate this December, she\xe2\x80\x99s completing interviews for medical schools.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBeing so close to what I really want to do in my life, I think before we label something as impossible, we need to just try,\xe2\x80\x9d Savchuk said. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out \xe2\x80\x94 maybe I will become something else \xe2\x80\x94 but at least I will know that I tried and did my best instead of just giving up.\xe2\x80\x9d'
