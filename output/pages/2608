b'Computer programmers know how to hack, but Grace Hopper knew much more \xe2\x80\x94 she was a life hacker.'
b'Local filmmaker Melissa Pierce presented 10 \xe2\x80\x9clife hacks\xe2\x80\x9d by Grace Hopper at the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership and Resource Center March 11 at an event sponsored by the Women in Science and Engineering Program.'
b'Pierce is unveiling the colorful life of computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral Hopper in a new documentary, \xe2\x80\x9cBorn with Curiosity: The Grace Hopper Story.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s set to release in December 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Dec. 9 would have been Hopper\xe2\x80\x99s 110th birthday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought I would make a film about her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierce, executive director of Chicago Women Developers. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when there are 12 films about Steve Jobs, another in the making, there needs to be one for Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hopper is known for coining the term \xe2\x80\x9cdebugging\xe2\x80\x9d after finding a moth in a computer.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cGrace made it famous because she found the first actual bug,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierce said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not what we should know of her.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Tackle big things'
b'Hopper didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn how to program until she was 37 years old.'
b'She was a mathematics professor before she joined the Navy on her third try during World War II. Hopper was denied the first two times for being underweight and holding a job too important to national security.'
b'Upon acceptance, Hopper was assigned to work on the Harvard Mark I: a 10,000-pound computer used in World War II. It was long before then that Hopper learned how to understand machines.'

b'Break stuff to understand it'
b'As a young girl, Hopper took apart seven alarm clocks to learn how they worked and how to fix them.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt illustrates the point that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid to break things apart,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierce said.'

b'Credit \xe2\x80\x93 give it and take it'
b'Hopper never forgot to credit the female team that worked with her.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGrace was incredible about the women she worked with,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierce said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knew that you should hold onto really good people and make concessions for them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hopper is associated with the creation of the COBOL language, one of the first high-level programming languages, Pierce said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut she came up with the idea of a compiler,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cA program that translates machine language into human language, which is what COBOL is based off.\xc2\xa0You can thank Grace for being able to have an app on your iPhone, and the same app on your friend\xe2\x80\x99s Android.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Persistence finds a way'
b'Hopper was a genius, but she was also persistent.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are framed as geniuses just because they persist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Veronica Arreola, director of the Women in Science and Engineering Program and the organizer of the event. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I know of Grace, she had this spirit that students could learn from.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven rocket scientists have to persist.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pierce is raising funds for \xe2\x80\x9cBorn with Curiosity\xe2\x80\x9d on the crowdsourcing site IndieGoGo. For more information, visit the film\xe2\x80\x99s website.'
