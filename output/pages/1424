b'\xe2\x80\x9cAwareness is the single most fundamental rule of chemical safety.\xe2\x80\x9d Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Illinois at Chicago is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for its students, staff, and faculty. The university requires its students, staff, and faculty to adhere to basic laboratory safety rules and guidelines with regards to the safe handling and use of chemicals, bio-hazardous materials, radioactive materials, and laboratory equipment.'
b'* Laboratory Training Signup Page: All the students, staff and faculty members participating in laboratory research/work must obtain laboratory safety training and acquire a laboratory safety training certificate (renewed annually) before starting any laboratory work. One copy of the certificate must be submitted to the main office and one to the laboratory PI; and one copy must be secured in a drawer or shelf in the laboratory designated for maintaining laboratory personnel certificates.'

b'SAFETY AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION PROGRAM'
b'The Safety and Chemical Engineering Education (SAChE) program,initiated in 1992, is a cooperative effort between the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) and engineering schools to provide teaching materials and programs that bring elements of process safety into the education of undergraduate and graduate students studying chemical and biochemical products and processes. SaChe Student Safety Certificate Program A  Certificate of Safety Achievement is presented by  SaChE and  AIChE to students who demonstrate proficiency in process safety training modules developed for SaChE. The program allows students to receive recognition for their efforts provided they are members of AIChE. To access these materials, please contact the AIChE Advisor for the student password. '
