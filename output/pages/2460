b'Their project, titled \xe2\x80\x9cPerceptions of Geo-Privacy Among Smartphone Users\xe2\x80\x9d, investigated the relationship between user perceptions of risk and actual behavior regarding geolocation privacy.'
b'Poster abstract: This study explores the relationship between user perceptions of risk and actual behavior regarding geolocation privacy. The primary focus is to understand how location-aware scenarios impact user attitudes towards and engagement with LBS-supported applications. Recent research involving location-aware scenarios indicates that user attitudes towards location services are negatively impacted by awareness, yet whether behavior changes once awareness is attained is less clear. This paper builds upon existing research concerning location-aware scenarios and expectations for privacy in order to understand the gap between user perceptions and actual behavior. Lastly, this work seeks to provide theory-informed best practices for alerting users to location-aware scenarios that provide the user more control.'
b'Congratulations!'
