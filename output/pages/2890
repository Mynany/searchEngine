b'Tuition and Fees'
b'Tuition and fees are assessed each semester per the number of credit hours for which a student is registered. A student\xe2\x80\x99s residency status is also taken into account and determines whether tuition will be assessed at the In-State or Out-of-State rate. Detailed tuition and fee information is housed on the Registrar\xe2\x80\x99s site: https://registrar.uic.edu/tuition/'
