b'The National Research and Training Center on Psychiatric Disability (NRTC) promotes access to effective consumer-driven and community-based services for adults with serious mental illness.  The Center is located at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the Department of Psychiatry.'
b'To enhance use of evidence-based practice in mental health and rehabilitation,\r\n      a program of rigorous research examines the outcomes of recovery self-management\r\n      models, consumer-to-consumer education, self-directed healthcare financing\r\n      mechanisms, Medicaid-funded peer services, consumer-operated programs,\r\n      and return-to-work services.'
b'The Center provides data-driven information, technical assistance, and\r\n      training that foster evidence translation, systems transformation, and\r\n      workforce development. Training and education include projects on consumer\r\n      leadership development, client self-advocacy, peer provider certification,\r\n      financial asset development, preparing for research careers, and inpatient\r\n      seclusion and restraint reduction.'
b'An innovative academic curricular transformation effort incorporates principles\r\n      of recovery and evidence-based practice into university instruction in\r\n      the medical, social, and behavioral sciences. Also offered are online workshops,\r\n      web casts, web-based continuing education courses, and a state of the science national summit held in  April 2009.'
