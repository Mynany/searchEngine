b'\xe2\x80\x9c(DSCC Care Coordinators and staff) were a shoulder to lean on. They showed that they genuinely cared about my well-being as I was growing up and through school. They really showed a lot of love and support for all of the hard things that we were going through."'
b' Zayd Jawad knows the challenges of growing up with a rare disease all too well. The 21-year-old was born with Hunter syndrome, a lysosomal storage disorder that affects his bodily systems and physical growth and devel...opment. '
b" UIC's Division of Specialized Care for Children was a constant presence throughout his childhood and adolescence, providing much-needed reassurance to Zayd and his parents. This support gave him hope and put him on the path to helping others."
b' Thank you, Zayd, for sharing your story and giving great advice for youth with special needs!'
